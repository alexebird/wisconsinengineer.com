Hurricane Wilma, the most intense Atlantic hurricane in history, inflicted $21 billion worth of damage in Florida, Mexico, and Cuba in 2005. </p>\r\n<p>Just a few months before Wilma, Hurricane\r\nKatrina—one of the deadliest hurricanes in\r\nthe history of the United States—left at least\r\n1,800 victims and $81.2 billion of damage in\r\nits wake. The carnage and devastation left\r\nby recent high-intensity storms has sparked\r\na new level of concern in how these natural\r\ndisasters develop, as a better understanding\r\nof the contributing factors might help prevent\r\nKatrina-scale tragedies in the future.</p>\r\n<p>This concern, coupled with the increasing\r\nintensity and frequency with which storms\r\noccur, has led to further research on their\r\ncauses. Based on a theory of correlation\r\ninitially proposed by Kerry Emanuel, atmospheric\r\nscientist at the Massachusetts\r\nInstitute of Technology, in 2005, a group of\r\nscientists at UW-Madison and the National\r\nClimatic Data Center have found evidence\r\nthat one of the causes of intensifying storms\r\nmight be the climate changes caused by\r\nglobal warming. The research has determined\r\nthat global warming, by way of\r\nincreasing sea-surface temperatures, contributes\r\nto stronger storms in the Atlantic\r\nOcean.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/wiscengr/september07/images/warming.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">James Kossin and his team have determined that global warming is linked to stronger storms in the Atlantic Ocean.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>James Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist\r\nin the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological\r\nSatellite Studies at UW-Madison,\r\nhas helped lead the research group’s quest\r\nto confirm this correlation between temperature\r\nand storm occurrence. According\r\nto Kossin, hurricanes need temperatures of\r\napproximately 26.5 degrees Celsius (81 degrees\r\nFahrenheit) at the water’s surface in\r\norder to form. His group’s findings indicate\r\nthat the Atlantic Ocean’s surface temperature\r\nnear the Caribbean Sea is about equal\r\nto this threshold temperature. The effect\r\nof global warming pushes it just over the\r\ntemperature and into the type of conditions\r\nthat could produce the massive storms that\r\nthe area has experienced.</p>\r\n<p>Kossin’s research focuses on the Atlantic\r\nOcean due to restrictions in data. Equipment\r\nused to identify and track hurricanes\r\nhas changed drastically in the last 50 years\r\nand being able to translate this data has\r\nbeen a difficult task.</p>\r\n<p>“The science behind the data is clear.\r\nBut the data collecting, in itself, has not\r\nbeen,” Kossin says. The team has worked\r\non smoothing out the data collected from\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean basin since 1983 when\r\nequipment became advanced enough to\r\nprovide reasonable data they can utilize\r\ntoday. The fact that the focus is on one particular\r\narea is significant, since it means\r\nthat none of the effects of sea-surface temperature\r\nthat the team has found apply\r\nto the rest of the world—not for now, at\r\nleast.</p>\r\n<p>Another important factor to consider is\r\nthat increases in sea-surface temperature\r\nare not the sole determinants in creating\r\nthe hurricanes that have ravaged the\r\nUnited States and Latin America. Often,\r\nhurricanes are “basin-dependent,” meaning\r\nthey occur because of patterns in the\r\nEarth’s composition. Also, vertical wind\r\nsheer, caused by the east-west trade\r\nwinds, is critical to these storms since the\r\npressure created by their interaction with\r\nsea-surface temperatures begins the process\r\nof creating a hurricane.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, as Kossin says, the effects of these\r\nstorms “have a lot of variability—interannual\r\nvariability, and very, very long\r\ncycles—and there are those who certainly\r\nbelieve such a cycle is taking place” in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, as well as across the rest\r\nof the world. The issue of whether or not\r\nhurricanes can be traced back to global\r\nwarming is hotly debated and many argue\r\nthat they are mostly caused by natural\r\nweather-cycle patterns. However, in the\r\nend, Kossin believes that the cause of the\r\nincreasingly intense hurricanes in the Atlantic\r\nOcean can be traced back to humanrelated\r\ncauses; the same ones that have\r\nmade global warming such a pressing\r\nissue in recent years.</p>', 'Anshu Khanna', 'Anshu is a senior studying industrial and systems engineering.

Sure, a diamond may be the strongest material on the earth, but a group of scientists at UW-Madison have taken away its crown as the stiffest material around.</p>\r\n<p>Stiffness is a property of a material that characterizes its resistance to deformation. Roderic Lakes, UW-Madison professor of engineering physics and mechanical engineering, published a paper in 2001 outlining the theory behind creating a material with extreme stiffness. The idea was to create an ultra-stiff composite by combining two materials—one with positive stiffness and one with negative stiffness. A material with positive stiffness pushes back in a direction opposing an applied force (think of a spring). Conversely, a material with negative stiffness doesn’t push back at all; instead, it increases the deformation in the direction of the applied force.</p>\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="../september07/images/SEP07stifferthandiamondWEB.jpg" width="250" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Don Stone, UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering, describes the structure of the new composite.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Although it would intuitively seem that combining these two materials would create a composite with minimal stiffness, it actually breaks the limits and creates a very stiff material.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s like putting anti-sugar into espresso and getting something sweeter than sugar,” Professor Lakes says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous attempts to create stiff composites used materials with only positive stiffness. For several years, a diverse team of engineers has been working to create a composite of tin and barium titanate that would exhibit extreme stiffness. There have been many technical challenges in physically creating the composite since the constituents must be combined very uniformly to make use of the phase transformation that the barium titanate undergoes.</p>\r\n<p>Tim Jaglinski, a former UW-Madison Ph.D. student in materials science, has been credited with finally creating the composite in the lab. Currently, researchers are testing the only sample of this material ever created.</p>\r\n<p>The composite’s extraordinary stiffness is derived from the technique used to combine the tin and barium titanate. Small amounts of barium titanate, a molecule which undergoes a solid phase transformation when it is heated or cooled, are suspended in a tin matrix. As the barium titanate attempts to exhibit its phase changing qualities within the tin, potential energy is stored within the composite. This potential energy counters the effects of pressure on the composite and is responsible for the composite’s exceptional resistance to pressure.</p>\r\n<p>One of the challenges for the team of engineers in preparing the composite for commercial use is the narrow temperature range at which the material displays this extreme stiffness. The composite has been shown to be stiffer than diamond within a 3 degree Fahrenheit range and stronger than steel within a 10 degree Fahrenheit range. However, recent theoretical experiments conducted by Walter Drugan, UW-Madison professor of engineering physics, have shown that it may be possible to extend the temperature range far beyond this.</p>\r\n<p>Although the material is stiff, there is no reason to suspect it will be as strong as a diamond, and therefore it is unable to replace diamond cutting tools. However, there may be useful applications for such a material in structures, airplanes, hard drive platters and robotic arms where increased stiffness could lead to more efficient designs. For instance, bridges could be built using less material if it was stiffer than diamond or even steel.</p> \r\n<p>“You wouldn’t build a bridge with diamonds,” Drugan says.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to being stiff, the new composite has a high phase angle resulting in high damping effects.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Lakes demonstrated a metallic ringing sound by tapping on the platters of a dissected hard drive to demonstrate characteristics of a material with a low phase angle. This ringing is due to vibrations within the material, which reduce the accuracy of the drive’s reading head, thereby reducing the maximum possible data density. The new composite could be used to create a hard drive with less vibration, capable of a higher data density</p>\r\n<p>This new composite has a promising future in industry, but for now it is relegated to a lab on campus while the synthesizing process and temperature characteristics are improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though your next piece of jewelry may not be tin and barium titanate composite, the material may find its way into your next computer hard drive.</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Adam Anders', 'Adam Anders is a junior majoring in electrical engineering and physics.', 'Eyleen Chou', 'Tsz Kit Chan', '2007-09-29', NULL),

('sep07engrempire', 'Expanding the engineering empire', 'article', NULL, 'September', 2007, '\r\n<p>Believe it or not, during the early 1900’s, the Education Building that is nestled on Bascom Hill once housed engineering students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of World War I, the College of Engineering was startled by a massive influx of students. Freshman enrollment doubled from 1916 to 1920, and the college administration realized that packing their students into overcrowded laboratories would not suffice. In response, they built a 20,000-square-foot, heavy-duty machine shop, nicknamed “Sawtooth,” on the north end of Camp Randall along University Avenue. This was the first mark of engineering territory. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the shop building was not enough. The building on Bascom Hill was still overflowing with engineering students, who now had to walk across campus to get to their shop classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean Turneaure, the engineering dean at the time, devised a solution. He appointed a construction committee to plan the design of the new engineering building on the Camp Randall site. Like the Spanish empire expanded into the western hemisphere in the 18th century, the engineering department expanded to the western side of campus.</p>\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="images/mechengbuilding.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">The newly renovated interior of the Mechanical Engineering Building provides students with an open, inviting place to do schoolwork.</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The new engineering building was three stories high, 81,000 square feet and formed a U-shape around the sawtooth shop. Needless to say, as of the 1931 fall semester, engineering faculty and students had more breathing room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was then; this is now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mechanical engineering has changed a lot in the last 75 years. It has become much more science-based, research-intensive and extremely high-tech,” Paul Peercy, dean of the College of Engineering, says. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support the advancing field of engineering, Peercy wanted a building that would be “state-of-the-art, but easily reconfigured as needs change with time—a building that would be flexible and usable for the next 50 or 75 years.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To meet this need, renovations to what is now known as the Mechanical Engineering Building included a new electrical and data infrastructure to support the several modern research laboratories, classrooms and lecture halls that the building now contains. Also, a new elevator was added that will make the building more accessible for disabled students and faculty. Finally, a new central heating, ventilating and air conditioning system to replace the multiple substandard mechanical systems that once served the building was installed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The total construction project more than doubles the square footage of the building,” Peercy says. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As immense as this building project was, the Mechanical Engineering Building wasn’t the only site of recent development in the engineering empire. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I came here as dean, I did some analyses and I found that about half the students that enter college saying they want a degree in engineering actually get a degree in engineering,” Peercy says. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number one reason the other half doesn’t earn a degree in engineering is because, as Peercy says, they have difficulty in math and science their first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assist the success of students in the College of Engineering, Peercy had a vision for a “welcoming, open and easily reconfigured” space where students can work in groups or individually and obtain the assistance they need. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of the 2007 spring semester, Engineering Hall received the 4,500-square-foot renovation Peercy envisioned: the Student Learning Center. This center encompasses a student information area, seminar rooms, a group tutoring area, a group study area, individual study areas, informal space and an internet café.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping it will let [engineering students] see it’s okay to study,” Peercy says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="images/enghall.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">The Supplementary instruction room, an enclosure within the Student Learning Center, allows students to learn from their peers.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>One way in which the Student Learning Center has especially assisted engineering students is the addition of the Supplementary Instruction (SI) room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI program, an outside-the-classroom academic support program to supplement lectures and discussions, was previously situated on the 4th floor of Wendt Library. During the busy hours—that is, after 4 p.m.—Wendt Library became very noisy, posing a problem for students trying to study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have always hoped we [would] have an enclosed area for us… and that [has] happened now,” Jia-Ling Lin, director of the program, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new SI room is completely enclosed by glass. This allows people outside the room to view the learning that’s going on inside (perhaps motivating them to join the SI program in the future), yet prevents outside noise from interfering with the learning inside the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I go to the SI room twice a week and have found it very helpful. It’s really nice to have an enclosed area to review material with others in my class,” Amy Lenz, a first-year engineering student at UW-Madison, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right next door to Engineering Hall, Wendt Library also saw changes this past semester. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alcove next to the front entrance of Wendt turned into an informal study area, equipped with comfy seating, painted walls and softer lighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re really trying to give [engineering students] a more relaxed space,” Deborah Helman, director of Wendt Library, says. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of the alcove, the carpeting—unchanged since the building’s opening in 1976—has finally been replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re looking for ways to upgrade the overall appearance of Wendt and make it more welcoming. We’re also looking for ways to facilitate group work and balance that with individual study space,” Helman says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This just goes to show how much the engineering community is coming together to improve the education of engineering students at UW-Madison. From new facilities available for better in-classroom learning to new study spaces available for out-of-classroom learning, the engineering campus continues to expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the College of Engineering has gone from a single building on Bascom Hill to an expansive empire north of Camp Randall.

His 33.5 hour flight transformed\r\nskeptics into believers, proving that\r\nlong distance flights were possible. The\r\nfeat earned him the $25,000 Orteig Prize,\r\noffered to the first person to fly the route.\r\nSeventy-seven years later in October of\r\n2004, SpaceShipOne (developed by Burt\r\nRutan’s company, Scaled Composites) was\r\nthe first non-government reusable manned\r\nspacecraft to travel repeatedly into space\r\n(twice within two weeks), winning the Ansari\r\nX-Prize of $10 million and pioneering\r\ncommercial space travel.

Also, orbital spacecrafts\r\nmust have the means to sustain human\r\nlife in space: including equipment to\r\nprovide oxygen, food, water and protection\r\nfrom radiation.</p><p>\r\nReaching the outer limits of Earth’s atmosphere\r\nrequires a lot of power and a lot of\r\nrocket fuel as it is, but SpaceShipOne (and\r\nSpaceShipTwo) require less fuel by launching\r\nfrom mid-air. Instead of launching vertically\r\nfrom the ground, like NASA’s space\r\nshuttle, a separate aircraft carries Space-\r\nShipOne to an altitude of about 46,000\r\nfeet and then drops it. During its freefall,\r\nSpaceShipOne’s relatively small rockets\r\nkick in and push it into space. This method\r\nrequires less fuel because drag decreases at\r\nhigher altitudes as the atmosphere thins.\r\nAnother advantage is that if the rockets fail,\r\nthe spacecraft can proceed with a normal\r\nlanding.</p><p>\r\n“You reduce the drag, and that’s probably\r\nthe biggest benefit of [an air launch],” Emmert\r\nsays.</p><p>\r\nBranson doesn’t plan on stopping at suborbital\r\nspaceflights.

Eighty years\r\nago, intercontinental air flights were just a\r\ndream reserved for daredevil pilots.</p><p>\r\n“You can never say, ‘They’ll never do this,\r\nand they’ll never do that,’ because things\r\nhave a way of evolving. People find ways\r\nto do it. Especially if there’s money to be\r\nmade, they’ll find a way,” Kammer says.\r\nWhen asked whether he’d accept a free\r\nticket on SpaceShipTwo, Kammer replied,\r\n“I’d love to go into space…Yeah, I’d go in\r\na second.”</p><p>\r\nToday, SpaceShipOne hangs in the Smithsonian\r\nnext to Lindbergh’s Spirit of St.\r\nLouis—two aircraft that paved the way for\r\ncommercial travel.

Until the university\r\ndetermines that swimming and laying in\r\nthe sun have substantial academic benefit,\r\nstudents and all who tire from watching\r\ntheir gas tanks devour their paychecks may\r\nwant to consider the hybrid alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hybrid can be any vehicle that combines\r\ntwo power sources, but today’s consumer\r\nhybrid vehicles are primarily gasoline-electric.\r\nThese hybrid cars typically achieve 30\r\nmiles per gallon (mpg) to 40 mpg on the\r\nhighway, far better than the 20 mpg to 30\r\nmpg rating for most conventional vehicles.\r\nBecause hybrid vehicles use less gasoline,\r\nthey are far more environmentally friendly\r\nthan conventional cars. Gasoline combustion\r\nproduces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse\r\ngas. Because hybrids are easy on the environment,\r\npurchasing one will also line your\r\npockets with a little more green come early\r\nApril.</p>\r\n<div class="right">\r\n\r\n<img src="images/SEPT07-Hybrid4-web.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“What few people will tell you is they get a\r\npretty generous tax credit for purchasing a\r\nhybrid,” Nick Rudolph, of Stark Chevrolet\r\nin Stoughton, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conventional cars must be designed with\r\nlarger engines capable of creating the necessary\r\nhorsepower and torque for situations\r\nsuch as highway merging, when considerable\r\nacceleration is necessary. Heavy,\r\nlarge-displacement engines and cylinders\r\nrequire a great deal of energy to operate.\r\nThese heavy components drive down gas\r\nmileage, and since typical highway driving\r\nrequires only a fraction of the engine’s total\r\nhorsepower capacity, its full power capabilities\r\nare used only when passing other\r\nvehicles or peeling out of beachside parking\r\nlots. Hybrid vehicles, on the other hand,\r\ncan be designed with smaller and more efficient\r\nengines. When the car requires an\r\nadditional boost during acceleration, a battery-\r\npowered electric motor kicks in.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid cars differ from their strictly electric\r\ncounterparts because they generate\r\ntheir own electricity and never need to be\r\ncharged with an outside power source. Hybrids\r\nuse regenerative braking, which converts\r\nthe heat from friction in the brakes into electrical energy that charges the hybrid’s\r\nbatteries.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Gasoline engines are efficient at high\r\nspeeds, so hybrids favor their gas engines\r\nwhen cruising on the highway. However,\r\nduring city driving the hybrid primarily\r\nuses its electric motor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These technological advancements come at\r\na price, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="images/SEPT07-Hybrid1-web.jpg" width="250" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Toyota’s Prius is the best-selling hybrid vehicle in the United States. This model\r\nis rated at 60 mpg city and 51 mpg highway.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“Toyota hybrids typically cost $3,000 to\r\n$4,000 more than the equivalent conventional\r\nmodel—most will recoup this money\r\nin five years. If you drive a lot in the city\r\nyou will get [your money] back in half that\r\ntime,” Jeff Seamans, of John Lancaster Toyota,\r\nsays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another hidden expense associated with\r\nhybrid vehicles is the possibility of high\r\nmaintenance costs down the road. Hybrid\r\nvehicles have not been on the market very\r\nlong, making it difficult to predict the cost\r\nof future repairs such as battery replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What are these hybrids going to cost to\r\nmaintain five years from now?” Rudolph\r\nsays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toyota, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler,\r\nHyundai, Ford and Audi will all be releasing\r\nnew hybrid models in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toyota plans to release its third generation\r\nhybrid Prius. The current model is the most\r\nfuel efficient hybrid on the market, earning\r\nan Environmental Protection Agency estimate\r\nof 60 mpg on the highway. The new\r\ndesign includes lighter lithium-ion batteries\r\nand a new Synergy Drive powertrain\r\nsystem that will be both half the weight and\r\ncost of the current Prius. Toyota’s line of\r\nhybrids also includes the Camry and Highlander;\r\nSeamans expects continued expansion\r\nand improvement in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Motors continues to implement hybrid\r\ntechnology into its high volume, high\r\nfuel consumption vehicles. General Motors,\r\nDaimler Chrysler and BMW have teamed\r\nup to develop a two-mode hybrid system.\r\nThis system uses two electric motors and\r\na dual-mode transmission. In other words,\r\nthe vehicle has both city and highway\r\nmodes. Each mode uses the electric motor\r\nand gas engine differently to provide optimal\r\ngas mileage.</P>\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="images/SEPT07-Hybrid3-web.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Gasoline-electric hybrids combine a gasoline engine that operates part of the time\r\nwith a battery-powered electric motor.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“These vehicles employ active fuel management;\r\nthey can shut off four of the eight cylinders\r\nto improve gas mileage,” Rudolph\r\nsays. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this two-mode system, consumers can\r\nexpect an increase in fuel economy—maybe\r\neven as high as 25 percent. This hybrid system\r\nwill be used in the 2008 Chevy Tahoe\r\nand GMC Yukon and is also expected to be\r\navailable in the Cadillac Escalade, Chevy\r\nSilverado and GMC Sierra models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“[In the future,] I think you will see diesel\r\nhybrids being brought in.

('sep07global', 'Engineering goes Global', 'article', 'Engineering students take their studies overseas', 'September', 2007, '\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Globalization is becoming increasingly\r\nimportant for all careers, including\r\nengineering. Being aware\r\nof global issues and other cultures lays the groundwork for all new learning experiences. There is no better way to experience other cultures and broaden one’s world view than to travel. According to Francis Bacon, “Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While UW-Madison is a renowned university in a beautiful city, there is only so much a classroom education can offer students who want to experience the world outside of Wisconsin. UW-Madison, however, does offer study abroad opportunities on five—soon to be six with the inclusion of a program in South Africa—of the seven continents. The choices of travel destinations are nearly endless, including Ecuador, Australia, Japan, Denmark and many more.</p>\r\n<p>“You can’t expect everybody to speak English, but try not to go where you’re comfortable, study abroad is about experiencing new things. Be flexible and take advantage of the opportunities you have. Challengeyourself to go to aplace you wouldprobably never seeotherwise,” TaliaEsser who studiedabroad in Budapest,Hungary, says.</p> \r\n<div class="right">\r\n\r\n<img src="images/studyabroad1.jpg" width="150" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Marrianne Bird Bear, international engineering office advisor, discusses the study abroad program with a student.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Typically, students choose to study abroad during their junior or senior years at UW-Madison and most stay abroad for just one semester. \r\n<p>“I’d say close to 75 of our approximately 100 annual study abroad students choose a semester long program, though some— particularly when studying another language— students do opt for a year long program because that language proficiency can come during that time,” Marianne Bird Bear, international engineering office advisor, says. </p>\r\n<p>The biggest piece of advice any student or advisor would give to a prospective study abroad student is to plan ahead. UW-Madison has partnerships with many universities around the world, so transferring credits is often an easy process, but not allcourses match up. It is important that students talk with an advisor before travelingto ensure that requirements are met without\r\ntoo much delay in graduation date.</p>\r\n<p>Graduation date, as many students who\r\nhave studied abroad urge, is not something\r\nto get caught up on. The life lessons a study\r\nabroad experience provides make a slightly\r\nlater graduation date worthwhile. There\r\nis no better place to learn flexibility and\r\nacceptance of new ways of thinking than\r\nstudying abroad.</p>\r\n<p>“If you ask an employer if they would\r\nrather hire a student who graduated in\r\nfour years or someone who can be flexible,\r\nadaptable and open to other points of view,\r\nI am confident they would choose the latter,”\r\nKate Theirren, who studied in Lyon,\r\nFrance, says.</p>\r\n<p>This experience doesn’t have to cost an arm\r\nand a leg, either. Tuition is comparable to\r\nthat of UW-Madison. The biggest difference\r\nin price is the cost of living, which varies\r\ngreatly depending on the country of study.\r\nIn Copenhagen, Denmark for example, the\r\ncost of living is much higher than in Budapest,\r\nHungary. The fees generally amount\r\nonly to a few hundred dollars more than\r\nstaying in Madison, and many need-based\r\nscholarships are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many students travel around the region\r\nwhile abroad, providing an invaluable\r\npathway for cultural discovery. Students\r\noften travel in small groups during school\r\nbreaks or on weekends. It is away from\r\nthe campus at local hangouts—not tourist\r\nsites—where one gets the best feel for the\r\nlifestyle in a particular place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Make it your trip. Don’t simply follow\r\nthe crowd. When else will this opportunity\r\narise?” Dibya Phuyal, who\r\nstudied in New Zealand,\r\nsays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If I had one suggestion for\r\nthose who intend to study\r\nabroad in the future, it’s this:\r\nMeet as many people as you\r\ncan from all over and visit\r\nthem. Nothing compares to\r\na typical night on the town\r\nin Berlin or celebrating\r\nQueen’s Day with 10 million\r\nDutch folk. Being a study\r\nabroad student, you can often\r\nget stuck in you own little\r\nworld,” Joe Hippensteel,\r\nwho studied in Spain, says.</p>\r\n<p>“Travel to the extent that\r\nyour resources permit. You\r\nwill inevitably return to\r\nUW-Madison after a term\r\nor year abroad with an understanding\r\nof yourself and\r\nother cultures that will give\r\nyou something unique to\r\nbring to any situation in\r\nwhich you find yourself,”\r\nTheirren says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is difficult to find a student who had a\r\nnegative experience abroad. Not only is\r\nit an amazing social opportunity to meet\r\nfriends and potential future colleagues from\r\naround the world, it is a great educational\r\nopportunity to see the way engineers work\r\nabroad. More and more, engineering is becoming\r\na global trade, and the additional\r\nexperience gained from interacting with\r\npeople from other cultures will strengthen\r\nany student’s résumé.</p>\r\n<p>“Stepping out of your cultural boundaries,\r\nand the US, not only allows you to experience\r\nanother culture first-hand but also\r\nhelps you to understand your own culture\r\nand identity as an American more than you\r\never could if you never left,” Theirren says</p>', 'Lynn Singletary', 'Lynn Singletary is a sophomore majoring in civil engineering.', 'Ahmad Juhari, Azyyati Hamizan, and Farah Jamil', 'Eric Hitt', '2007-09-29', NULL),

You walk into a professor’s office and wonder how any work could possibly be accomplished in that room due to an enormous jungle of paper and disarray. Upon walking into Susan’s office, I was immediately struck by its neat and tidy appearance. In fact, her only flaw seems to be drinking too much coffee.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is something else that really makes her special: her passion for people.</p>\r\n<p>“Susan is an excellent teacher, but her willingness to develop a personal relationship with each of her students is what truly makes her stand apart,” Kevin Jayne, writing editor at Wisconsin Engineer, says.</p>\r\n<p>Susan Hellstrom became a member of the academic staff in the engineering professional development (EPD) department in 1998. She quickly became involved with Wisconsin Engineer magazine, serving as co-advisor with Steve Zwickel for one year and then becoming the full-time advisor in fall 2000. Since then, students have benefited immensely from her impact. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I would describe Susan Hellstrom as a mentor, coach, instructor, counselor, friend and my mother away from home,” Phil Mauermann, advertising manager, says.</p>\r\n<p>“[Susan] became a mentor and a friend. She offered advice when I asked for it and a listening ear when she knew I needed it,” Karen Mandl, former editor-in-chief, says.  </p>\r\n<p>“Susan cares deeply about her students. We were lucky to have an adviser who is so generous with her time, and the students in her classes benefited from that same generosity,” Kyle Oliver, former writing editor, says. </p>\r\n<p>As you might have guessed, Hellstrom’s other joy is journalism. Since graduating in that field from Ohio State University, she has been a technical writer, a movie reviewer, a staff writer for the Associated Press and a copy editor for the Capital Times. She loves magazines, especially Bon Appetit and National Geographic Traveler. And, although she enjoys all the classes she teaches, Wisconsin Engineer is one of her favorites and is a natural fit.</p>\r\n<p>“It combines my love for journalism and my love of working with students. It also makes a big difference,” Hellstrom adds with a smile, “that all the students want to be there.”</p>\r\n<p>“[Wisconsin Engineer] brings engineering and science to life for our readers, gives our engineering students [on staff] a chance to showcase their communication skills and serves as an unofficial historical record of the College of Engineering and university,” Hellstrom says.</p>\r\n<p>Sadly, Hellstrom is saying goodbye to UW-Madison.</p>\r\n<p>Susan and her husband Eric, who has been a professor of materials science and engineering at UW-Madison since 1985, have decided to move to Tallahassee, Florida, the new home of the Applied Superconductivity Center, with which Eric has been working for the past 20 years. While their two children, Sonja and Brett, attend college elsewhere, Eric and Susan will both be teaching at Florida State University. Eric will be a member of the mechanical engineering faculty and will also be affiliated with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, while Susan will have a split appointment, teaching in the English department and working on publications for the College of Arts and Sciences. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="../september07/images/proffessorprofile2.jpg" width="250" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Wisconsin Engineer staff members celebrate another successful year at Susan’s final meeting.

She provides steady guidance for a magazine staff that is always changing as students graduate.</p>\r\n<p>One specific challenge arose after the 9/11 catastrophe. At the time, the magazine relied on pizza sales and advertisements from job recruiters for funding. With the resulting job market fallout, there was a corresponding loss in recruiting and advertisements fell significantly. The magazine faced a financial crisis and fell severely in debt to its publisher. Despite the scary situation, Hellstrom is proud of the turnaround.</p>\r\n<p>“I used to lie awake at night…but the students rose to the challenge,” Hellstrom says. They drastically cut spending and increased fundraising with more pizza sales and the addition of Per Mar security fundraising for Kohl Center and Camp Randall events.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, Hellstrom has been a part of many positive achievements for the magazine. Wisconsin Engineer has been very successful at Engineering College Magazine Associated (including winning “Best All-Around Magazine”) and working towards the digital archiving of back-issues through the university library system.</p>\r\n<p>Hellstrom is definitely an involved faculty member, serving on the University Library Committee and various other committees within the EPD department. She has also been asked to speak about communication issues at numerous events outside the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite her success and experience, Susan has a goal to never micromanage people and always lets the students make their own decisions.</p>\r\n<p>“[Students] are completely capable, and it’s the only way to learn,” Hellstrom says.</p>\r\n<p>When asked about the best part of the magazine, her answer is simple.</p>\r\n<p>“Definitely the people. Of course there’s the journalism angle, but it really is the people, and I’ve been blessed to work with some absolutely wonderful students.”</p>\r\n<p>And no doubt, UW-Madison and the members of Wisconsin Engineer will miss a teacher, advisor, mentor and friend.</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Marshall Stringfield', 'Marshall Stringfield is a fifth-year senior graduating in December with a B.S. in industrial and systems engineering and a certificate in technical communications.', 'Nurhuda Adam and Muhamad Asyraf Yahaya', 'Amanda Austreng', '2007-09-29', NULL),

  </div><p>I wasn’t quite sure what to expect of this summer. A lot of things were different. For starters, many of my friends were interning out of state or even moving away to prepare for grad school. Additionally, I was beginning a disappearing act involving a three week backpacking excursion through Europe, an eight-month co-op and a semester of study abroad in Finland. It was hard for me to even imagine the Madison that I would be returning to. </p>\r\n<p>The backpacking was an adventure in itself—hopping on the wrong trains in France, witnessing political rallies in Spain, stumbling through broken Italian—the list goes on. I had only been to Europe once before and it was for a week-long vacation over spring break with my family way back when I was a freshman in high school. This time it was just me, one other engineering student and two backpacks full of warm-weather clothes. Maybe someone should have reminded me that this wasn’t some beachside vacation. I ended up wearing my Marmot jacket a whole lot more than I wore that swimsuit I had so deliberately packed.</p>\r\n<p>I felt so lost from the instant we arrived in Rome. Maybe it was the fact that I speak but one word of Italian—if you count “gelato.” Or it could it have been the fact that I had been warned by my family about the pickpockets, my guy friends about the Italian men and my girl friends about the ridiculous amount of carbs I would be consuming. I wouldn’t want to eat an entire plate of spaghetti…let alone three.</p>\r\n<p>It was painfully obvious that I had no clue what I was in for. Despite the warnings from the hotelier, the weather websites I had visited before departure and my travel companion, I couldn’t quite grasp the concept of what “enough water” is to be drinking during the blazing Roman heat. I blacked out from heat stroke at the Roman Forum a mere 24 hours after arrival in the historic city. Maybe this is where the stereotype of clueless Americans comes from?</p>\r\n<p>By day two, I was still a little unnerved by the complexity of just making it through a single day in a city where the language and culture was completely beyond my comfort zone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the day I had a big realization.</p>\r\n<p>In walking through the Vatican, we ran into a girl I was friends with in the dorms and a pack of biomedical engineers from UW-Madison. The next day, walking down the street near the train station in Rome, we ran into a girl I knew from the Institute of Industrial Engineers who was living in Italy for a chunk of her summer. </p>\r\n<p>What I realized is this—you can get lost in whatever city you want, move anywhere your heart desires, and no matter where you go, you always have a piece of Madison with you. Of course, “Madison” will change because while you’re away from the physical 85 or so square miles that encompasses the city, you will change, too. </p>\r\n<p>However, you can rest assured that the spirit of Madison—and a Badger or two—are never far from reach.</p>', 'Nicole Rybeck', NULL, NULL, 'Amanda Austreng', '2007-09-29', NULL);

This device is designed to block blood from entering the aneurysm while withstanding dynamic forces acting upon it.</div>\r\n</div><p>One morning, while making breakfast, you spill a little milk. To clean up the mess, you rip off tiny pieces of paper towel and place them on the puddle, one by one.</p><p>This inefficient process is similar to the current\r\naneurysm treatment available for patients.</p><p>An aneurysm is a balloon-like dilatation in a blood vessel wall. This dilatation can form in any vessel throughout your body; however,\r\nDr. Roham Moftakhar, chief resident in the UW-Madison neurological surgery department, is specifically concerned with cerebral aneurysms.</p><p>“These aneurysms take place because the [blood vessel] wall in your brain gets weakened,\r\nand it sort of blisters out, and when it blisters out there is a risk of rupture,” Moftakhar\r\nsays.</p><p>When an aneurysm ruptures, blood flows out into the area of the skull surrounding\r\nthe brain. There’s often quick onset of a headache—the worst headache of a person’s\r\nlife. Half the people with a ruptured aneurysm, Moftakhar says, never make it to the hospital—they die at home.</p><p>In the other half, the puncture is blocked off by clotted blood, thus containing the aneurysm.\r\nThese patients can make it to the hospital in time for surgery.</p><p>However, the procedures that are currently used in the operating room, endovascular coiling and open surgery clipping, are often inefficient and unsafe.</p><p>Endovascular coiling involves “a bunch of wire [coils] that they just randomly shove into the aneurysm,” Wendy Crone, professor\r\nof engineering physics at UW-Madison who partnered up with Moftakhar, says.</p><p>A catheter is a thin, hollow, flexible tube that is inserted through a blood vessel in the groin and guided through the venous system, with the help of an imaging technique\r\ncalled fluoroscopy. Small metal coils are then deposited through the catheter into the aneurysm to block off blood flow. This process can take anywhere from two to eight hours.</p><p>According to Kristyn Masters, professor of biomedical engineering at UW-Madison who later joined Moftakhar’s team, the metal coils are about three times the diameter\r\nof a human hair. They are made out of Nitinol, a shape-memory alloy that can be treated to remember a specific shape. Even after being straightened for travel through the catheter, the coils return to the predetermined\r\nshape inside the aneurysm.</p><p>However, this procedure is relatively unsafe.</p><p>“Every time you introduce a new coil, it’s more risk of death—more risk of complications—\r\nbecause it’s essentially many procedures\r\nall in a row,” Masters says.</p><p>Another risk of endovascular coiling is coil compaction, the result of blood flow pressure\r\npushing the coils deeper into the aneurysm.\r\nAccording to Masters, 30 percent of aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling undergo coil compaction, which may “lead to enlargement or rupture of the aneurysm.”</p><p>“[The method is also] really imprecise in terms of they don’t even know how many coils they’re going to use [and] how long it’s going to take. It’s just shove coils in there until it’s full, and that’s not how engineers like to do things,” Masters says.</p><p>The other treatment available to block off blood flow to the aneurysm is open surgery clipping. This extravascular procedure involves\r\nremoving a piece of the patient’s skull, locating the aneurysm, then “clipping”\r\nit at the neck with a device similar to a metal clothespin. It takes about three to four hours to complete.</p><p>“When you have to approach from outside the blood vessel, especially somewhere as sensitive as your head, it’s going to be really hard to be digging around and finding the aneurysm,” Masters says.</p><p>Consequently, clipping as an aneurysm treatment is being phased out.</p><p>Rather than resorting to the lesser of two evils, Moftakhar wanted to develop a less time-consuming and less hazardous treatment.\r\nTogether with Crone and Masters, the team came up with the idea of a single coil opening up a polymer shell.</p><p>The Nitinol alloy is used to create a sturdy and compliant coil, which essentially inflates\r\na balloon-like shell by aligning along its circumference.</p><p>The shell is composed of polyurethane, a biocompatible elastic material, and hyaluronic\r\nacid, a substance necessary for wound healing.</p><p>“People complain about their breast implants\r\nlooking all funny and misshapen; it’s because the body essentially came in and performed what’s called a fibrotic response, which means it formed a scar around the implant. In that case, it was really bad; in this case, it’s what we’re trying to do. We want the body [to] form a scar around this [device] in order to wall off the aneurysm,” Masters says.</p><p>This copolymer shell combined with the Nitinol coil frame results in a device that, as Moftakhar puts it, “blocks the aneurysm in one step.”</p><p>It’s also a much safer treatment.

Five years later, deer have continued to test positive across most of the southern portion\r\nof Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is this disease able to spread between animals so efficiently? A team of UW-Madison\r\nresearchers has found that the agent responsible for diseases such as CWD and Mad Cow Disease can bind to soil particles, allowing it to remain in the environment for many years. In addition to increasing longevity, the binding also makes the agent far more infective.

In addition to increasing longevity, the binding also makes the agent far more infective. When bound to soil, there is a higher probability of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is an interaction between the abnormal\r\nform of the protein, that all of us have with the infection associated form of the protein and that somehow that interaction results in conversion… creating more abnormal\r\nproteins,” Judd Aiken, UW-Madison\r\nprofessor of veterinary medicine, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prion has a very different structure from that of normal proteins. As the disease\r\nprogresses, this structure change literally\r\nopens holes in the animal’s brain. These prions also “have a tendency to clump into a cluster of proteins,” Aiken says. The growing cluster of these prions is eventually\r\nfatal to the infected animal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prions can also be easily transmitted orally from one animal to another. The disease can spread when an infected animal interacts\r\nwith a healthy one. Scientists have also known for decades that prions are capable of surviving in the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There have been deer studies in Colorado where they place healthy deer in pens that once held infected deer, and those deer came down with the disease,” Aiken says.In the interest of determining how an environment\r\ncould be infected, Aiken and Joel Pedersen, UW-Madison professors of soil science, formed a partnership to determine what was happening to the prion when it reached the soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Is that infectious agent filtering through the soil, or is it staying up on the soil potentially\r\nas a source of infection for other animals?” Aiken says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="../november07/images/prions/NOV07prion4web.jpg" width="250" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption">Dr. Johnson prepares a soil sample that will be bound with disease-causing prions.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As the team began to investigate, they found that when soil and prions are mixed, a bond is formed between the two.

They tested clay, silt, sand and three different\r\norganic top soils. The results demonstrate\r\nthat the prions are capable of binding to clay soils with small particle sizes, up to large particle size soils such as sand.</p><p>\r\n“This binding was so tight that I originally thought—wrongly—that the bound material\r\nwould not be as infectious… and I was completely wrong on that guess,” Aiken says.\r\nIt turned out that the prions are far more infectious when they are bound to the soil. “You bind it to clay and you end up with something\r\nthat is 700 times more infectious,” Aiken says.</p><p>\r\nThis discovery may explain\r\nwhy the disease is so easily transferred from one animal to another.\r\nEven in a heavily infected area, the animals are exposed to very low levels of prions through the saliva of infected animals. In addition, according to Aiken, oral infection isn’t a very efficient means of transmission. These facts have left many researchers puzzled at how the disease\r\ncan spread so quickly and easily.</p><p>\r\n\r\n“We think this binding to soil is probably the answer,” Aiken says. The soil in an infected\r\narea may serve as a catalyst that increases\r\nthe chance of infection.</p><p>\r\nPedersen and Aiken have not definitively determined why prions bound to soil are more infectious, but they have developed several plausible theories. The team believes\r\nthat the prions can transfer from the gut to the body more easily when they are bound to soil. Aiken believes there may be some active transfer of the bound prion that does not exist when the prion is not bound to soil particles. Another possibility is the soil particle protects the prion as it moves through the animal’s digestive system. Finally,\r\nit is possible that the protein aggregate\r\ngets broken into smaller pieces by the bound soil particles.</p><p>\r\n“If you have more pieces you have more infectious agent,” Aiken says. Aiken admits that there is still much work to be done to fully understand this binding.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="../november07/images/prions/NOV07prion3web.jpg" width="250" alt="" />\r\n<div class="caption"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe team of researchers is just beginning to dig into the implications of these findings and find a definitive answer to how these diseases can spread so easily.

This noninvasive\r\nstimulation creates weak electric currents\r\nin the brain through electromagnetic induction. These currents can be targeted specifically in time and space, allowing researchers\r\nto stimulate very specific areas of the brain. UW-Madison is one of the first universities in the country to purchase commercially\r\navailable TMS equipment that is coupled with an electroencephalogram (EEG) for brain activity monitoring.

The bridge, located near the University of Minnesota, collapsed, claiming the lives of 13 people and injuring nearly 100 more.</p>\r\n<p>At 6 p.m., after serving for 40 years as the main route for Minneapolis commuters to cross the Mississippi, the central span of the bridge collapsed. As it crashed, it brought with it the adjacent spans and everything on top. As the dust settled, questions arose about the cause of the collapse and the safety\r\nof other, similar bridges nationwide.</p>\r\n<p>The I-35W bridge was a steel truss bridge. It stood 115 feet high and ran 1900 feet across the Mississippi River. Featuring a relatively uncomplicated design, truss bridges have been used in the United States for over 150 years. Their simplicity, efficiency and cheap construction cost have made them a popular\r\nstyle of bridge around the world.</p>\r\n<p>A steel truss bridge is made of a concrete substructure, a steel superstructure and paved deck surface. The superstructure — the component most likely responsible for failure — is made up of vertical and diagonal\r\nbeams attached to supports called chords. Possible failure may be attributed to stress and fatigue in the uppermost chords of the bridge. Another possibility is that the failure occurred at the joints between the beams and chords.</p>\r\n<p>The cause of the I-35W bridge collapse has yet to be determined, but engineers are working diligently to find answers.</p>\r\n<p>This catastrophe has brought to the table a host of questions from the average commuter.\r\nHow is the safety of a bridge rated by engineers? How are funds distributed for bridge maintenance and repair? These issues have come under much public scrutiny\r\nsince August 1.</p>\r\n<p>Many bridges are classified as “structurally deficient,” but the term’s meaning is often unclear. It is used to describe a bridge’s condition\r\nas it has weathered the elements over the years.</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/35W/BW44 photo used in layout.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The I-35W bridge wreckage as seen from the adjacent 10th Avenue Bridge. Construction\r\non a replacement bridge began in mid-November.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“‘Structurally deficient’ does not mean that a bridge is unsafe, but that some part of it needs to be repaired,” Lawrence Bank, professor\r\nof civil engineering at UW-Madison, says.</p>\r\n<p>Two rating systems are commonly used in determining whether or not a bridge is in need of replacement or repair. The first is the American Association of State Highway\r\nand Transportation Official’s Guide for Commonly Recognized Structural Elements.\r\nIt is a number-based ranking system in which a surveyor assigns the substructure,\r\nsuperstructure and deck a rating between\r\none and nine. A score from 1-3 is a very poor rating and from 6-9 is an acceptable\r\nto excellent rating. Middle scores, however, are difficult to interpret.</p>\r\n<p>If a section of the bridge scores a 4, then it must be repaired immediately. However, if it achieves a 5, it does not require\r\nimmediate attention. Naturally, assigning a bridge either rating comes with enormous consequence. There is a fine line between a rating of 4 or 5, and it is often unclear which a bridge should receive.</p>\r\n<p>Another, more precise, rating scale used in determining the\r\nintegrity of a bridge is the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Sufficiency Number. This rating gives a slightly more clear idea of a bridge’s health.</p>\r\n<p>The DOT Sufficiency Number is a rating from 1-100 describing the amount of deterioration on a bridge. A rating of 80 or above is a good rating and requires no immediate attention. If a bridge drops below a rating of 80, it is eligible to receive funds for\r\nrehabilitation. If a bridge drops below 50, it is in need of immediate\r\nrepair. The I-35W Bridge had been given a DOT sufficiency\r\nnumber of 50.</p>\r\n<p>There are also translation to action difficulties with the DOT Sufficiency Number as the rating does not explicitly state what kind of repairs are necessary or a time line for their completion.</p>\r\n<p>“Even though some of the numbers look frightening, they do not mean that the bridge is unsafe to drive on,” Bank says. The I-35W bridge’s score of 50 may seem alarming at initial glance, but further research would explain that it was just the result of expected wear and tear.</p>\r\n<p>“You could have a bridge rated below 50 on sufficiency and yet it is structurally sufficient. After this disaster in Minneapolis, I think we will rethink the way we refer to this,” Bank says.</p>\r\n<p>The collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota has called\r\nattention to the perhaps abstruse way we rate the integrity\r\nof our nation’s bridges. It may lead to changes or amendments in safety rating systems and a new definition of the term “structurally\r\ndeficient.” The catastrophe in Minneapolis will help our nation to better prioritize funding and rehabilitation efforts in maintaining our bridges and ensuring the safety of commuters.</p>', 'Matt Treske', 'Matt Treske is a second year student at UW-Madison.', 'Vincent Mi', 'Eric Harris', NULL, NULL),

I was feeling pretty good—until I walked outside and onto a disaster scene. Just three blocks away, the Interstate 35W bridge had collapsed into the Mississippi\r\nRiver. The collapse occurred during rush hour on August 1, and the bridge—my usual route home—had been lined with cars. Cell phone service was out, so I walked around gathering details about what had just happened in bits and pieces from panicked pedestrians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unable to get my car out of the parking lot and with nowhere else to go, I made my way along the river, searching for a route to walk back to the east bank and towards my apartment. I finally found an open bridge, and a clear vantage point of the wreckage that had been a major artery of the city. Rescuers frantically\r\nused boats and helicopters to help those on the bridge and in the water. As I stood and watched, I felt a chill. Engineers designed this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cause of the collapse will undoubtedly be under investigation for years to come. It could have been anything from normal wear to a combination of perfect loading and freak vibrations. It could have also been an engineering error.\r\nThis semester, I will finish my degree at UW-Madison and begin a career as an engineer. Amidst my excitement to launch this new chapter\r\nof my life, it is sobering to realize that engineers’ work is so much more than solving problems and designing new technology. What engineers do can greatly enhance life for many people. However, slight miscalculations and unforeseen influences can turn a “perfectly” designed product into a failure. More than that—and what really struck close to home for me—a design failure is no longer just a few points off the grade for a school project, it can affect the safety and wellbeing of real people, even impact entire cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engineering is an enormous responsibility. Whether designing bridges, formulating alternative fuel sources (see page 14) or brainstorming novel medical treatments (see page 8) engineers need to be mindful of their duty to society. The National Society of Professional Engineers maintains an engineering code of ethics. The first point of this code, I believe, says it all. It reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all graduates of UW-Madison, I know that there is something special about this university. I cannot imagine spending the last four (and a half) years anywhere else. This place, along with the people with whom I have shared my time here, has challenged me and changed me in ways that I never imagined possible. As I reflect on my preparedness to enter the ranks of engineers, I am thankful that UW-Madison has equipped me, and my fellow graduates, with the requisite knowledge and skills. But perhaps more importantly, I appreciate that my experience here has made me mindful of the societal responsibility that I take on when I accept a job in engineering.

Citizens there were forced to find a way to generate their own electricity. Wind turbines—machines that utilize the power of wind to generate electricity—are very popular in the village, and many of the villagers have made their own. The homemade wind turbines are scaled-down versions of the very large turbines people typically see. The 30 to 40 houses in the village used a combination of solar power and wind turbines to power their homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of every summer, a wind turbine designer with 30 years of experience puts on a workshop teaching the villagers how to build the turbines out of wood and metal. Venkataramanan’s trip allowed him the opportunity to take part in this workshop where he learned information he could use to teach students at UW-Madison the same skills. He worked with the featured designer and learned about the tools, materials and knowledge he would need to build turbines on his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venkataramanan’s next stop was at the University of California-Berkeley, where he began to use what he learned in Scotland. He worked with a group of 10 students who volunteered time outside of class. The group met and worked on their wind turbine in a team member’s garage off campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Desiring more practice with building wind turbines, Venkataramanan then traveled to Brazil and Turkey. In each country, he gathered small groups of students to teach them the trade. Venkataramanan was now starting to perfect the process of building the turbines, so he returned to UW-Madison inspired to create new classes and programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venkataramanan’s first big move on campus was leading two small groups of students in INTEREGR 160: “Intro to Engineering Design.” He worked with each group every Monday night for three hours, producing two small wind turbines as he did in Scotland. As Venkataramanan had hoped, his efforts to spread his knowledge did not go unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A technical communications group asked Venkataramanan if they could film part of every lab to air on the new Big 10 Network, which features academic material 90 minutes a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This was one of the first non-sports programs they aired on the Big 10 Network,” Venkataramanan says. He was very excited to know that his new knowledge was being spread to schools other than UW-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, building wind turbines is not Venkataramanan’s only goal. He is currently seeking grants to start new courses that deal with the theoretical operation of a wind turbine as it will be a good compliment to learning about practical construction issues. He is also starting to plan out a new certificate program for the engineering curriculum called Engineering for Energy Sustainability. This certificate will give engineers a different way to specialize their major and will be a great opportunity for those concerned about energy issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to his other exploits, Venkataramanan is writing a proposal for a program to build turbines off campus.

Good\r\ncommunication will ensure that technologies\r\nand resources are shared in a synergistic\r\nfashion to give this project its best shot\r\nat success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest hurdle in converting plant biomass\r\nto liquid fuel is the conversion of cellulose\r\nto simple sugars. Every year more\r\nthan 1.3 billion tons of biomass cellulose is\r\ndisposed of as waste. Cellulose is a polymer\r\nof sugars which is resistant to chemical, enzymatic\r\nand temperature degradation. This\r\nmeans that the compound cannot be readily\r\nbroken down into its component simple\r\nsugars. According to Donohue, if a process\r\nwas available to convert 1 billion tons of\r\nbiomass cellulose into simple sugars, there\r\nwould be enough feedstock for ethanol\r\nproduction to offset nearly 30 percent of\r\nimported petroleum-derived fuel.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/Biomass/NOV07biomass8web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">“If we could accomplish [the process of deriving ethanol from biomass],\r\nthe consumer would not even know the difference. What you pumped into the\r\ntank would just be gasoline or diesel; you would never know where it came from,”\r\nDumesic says.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ethanol we use today comes from simple\r\nsugars in corn kernels. Therefore, the process of deriving ethanol leaves the corn cob and stalk as unusable biomass. One major goal of the GLBRC is to figure out how to break down cellulose, releasing the simple sugars to be used as the feedstock for liquid fuel. This will be accomplished either by breeding plants with a cellulose polymer, that is easier to degrade, or by deriving\r\na new process that effectively breaks down cellulose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is a lot of interest now to focus on ethanol as the end product, because we know how to make it. We have been making\r\nethanol from sugars for hundreds of years. We make a lot of it in Milwaukee and in St. Louis,” Donohue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many groups on campus and around the country who are working to make the fermentation process more efficient\r\non a large scale, but ethanol has intrinsic\r\nproperties which make it a less-than-ideal transportation fuel. First, ethanol has a lower energy value than gasoline. This translates to fewer miles per gallon when used in automobiles. Also, ethanol is a polar\r\nmolecule and readily dissolves in water. Water present in the fuel further degrades its energy value.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/Biomass/NOV07biomass2web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The future of biomass as a potential fuel source will dramatically influence\r\nrural landscape as production becomes commercial.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of the biological communities\r\nwork on producing ethanol, James Dumesic, UW-Madison professor of chemical\r\nand biological engineering, and his team in the catalyst community are looking at using catalysts for converting biomass to liquid fuel in forms other than ethanol. One such fuel that they’ve derived is dimethyl furan (DMF). This research was published in Nature on June 21 of this year. DMF is a molecule that is similar to ethanol in that it contains oxygen and can be used as a fuel additive; but it has a 40 percent higher energy\r\ncontent and is non-polar, so it separates from water.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Dumesic and his team are trying to develop a process that can convert biomass-derived simple sugars into liquid alkanes ranging in length from 7 to 15 carbon atoms — the same composition as premium sulfur-free diesel fuel or gasoline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If we could accomplish that process, the consumer would not even know the difference.\r\nWhat you pumped into the tank would just be gasoline or diesel, you would never know where it came from,” Dumesic says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fuel source would not need to be specified\r\nat the pump, as with other alternative fuels like E85, because the characteristics of the fuels would be exactly the same. This research has been proven in the lab and, at press time, results had been submitted for publication in Green Chemistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/Biomass/NOV07biomass1web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Tim Donohue, GLBRC director and professor of bacteriology at UW-Madison.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The technologies used in this conversion of biomass-derived sugar into gasoline or diesel are about five years out. According to Dumesic, the major hurdle is taking this process to large-scale production. The catalyst\r\ncurrently used in the lab is expensive, and there is no indication of its working lifetime.\r\nIf the catalyst is able to last for a long time, its cost will not be much of an issue; however, if the catalyst becomes contaminated\r\nand needs to be changed frequently the cost will fall on the consumer and likely block this technology from taking hold in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a petrol-like liquid fuel seems to be the direction in which we are inevitably headed. Reasons such as national security, energy independence and global climate change all weigh heavily, and the push for a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio is gaining momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In less than 100 years we have used a significant\r\nportion of fossil fuels which took millions of years to form, and we are going to run out of these fuels sooner than later,” Donohue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the year 2000, the U.S. has imported more than 12 billion barrels of oil. Numbers of oil barrels have been increasing for the past several decades. If we were to reach the bottom of the petroleum well or upset trade conditions, the U.S. as a nation would be in a very vulnerable position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“From a state’s perspective we would like to reduce our dependence on energy that comes from outside the state. The people of Wisconsin would like to be a cost-neutral energy state. Given the amount of forestry and agricultural land, there is no reason that we should not be energy-independent and cost neutral,” Donohue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/Biomass/NOV07biomass6web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Dimethyl furan, or DMF, is used by the UW Catalysis Research Lab as a catalyst to convert simple sugars such as D-fructose into long-chain</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the scientific community seems to have reached the general consensus that we are in the midst of a massive global climate\r\nshift. Whether or not humans are the direct cause of this shift still sparks debate, but our means of producing power and fueling transportation do emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, a known greenhouse gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What we have done…is put a lot of old carbon into the atmosphere. As we start to use plant material, we are also going to be converting that into carbon, but it will be new carbon which was fixed in the last year’s growing cycle,” Donahue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By relying on biomass-derived fuel, we will theoretically reduce the amount of old carbon released into the atmosphere, potentially stifling\r\nthe negative effect burning fossil fuels has on the atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GLBRC will consider technologies which are economically viable\r\nand environmentally sustainable. Both aspects are of equal importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are very interested in developing technologies which will work on the land in the long run. We do not want to produce new breeds of plants or new agriculture practices that prevent the land from being able to sustain farming because then we will have created a larger problem than we have solved,” Donohue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many issues to consider before rolling out technologies such as those that the GLRBC will generate. Also, scaling the technologies\r\nto the level which will be needed to make up a significant portion of our liquid fuel demand will be complicated. There is an inevitable give-and-take relationship between energy production and the environment, and careful thought and foresight must be used with any new technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The DOE realizes that we are embarking on a long-term mission. Like the mission we embarked on in the 60’s to send a man to the moon and in the 80’s when we said we wanted to sequence the human\r\ngenome—we are part of a grand scientific mission,” Donahue says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is understood that this is a massive undertaking and the DOE does not expect to see an immediate solution. They do, however, expect that the funds provided will produce certain deliverable products and processes which will aid the cause. The DOE will evaluate the progress of the GLBRC based on yearly deliverables, at which point they will determine the subsequent year’s funding. These are critical to the future of the GLBRC as they will be a way for elected officials to see what the program has accomplished and where it is headed. This is a large investment and there is no way politicians can micromanage\r\nthe center. Deliverables will give the annual feedback needed\r\nfor politicians to justify the cost to their taxpaying constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the joint effort of many people working towards a secure and sustainable energy future, it is not hard to imagine that the wasteful consumption of fossil fuels will be soon out of style and a thing of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For every gallon of fossil fuels we don’t use, that is one less gallon we have to worry about replacing,” Donohue says.</p>', 'Matt Stauffer', 'Matt Stauffer is a fourth year student in materialsscience engineering and a force to be reckoned with on the ping-pong table.', 'Matson Contardo', 'Mike Popelka', NULL, NULL),

Today, corporations\r\nand consumers alike have the ability to keep themselves connected in an increasingly seamless manner. First came the 10-pound cellular phone and its now-humorous cousin, the car phone. These devices shrank in size and grew in power at an amazing rate over the last 15 years. Today, we see devices that fit neatly in our pocket and connect us to the world in ways we once only dreamed of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s “mobile Internet devices” offer an Internet browser, e-mail client, messaging client and cellular phone rolled into a highly\r\nportable device that can comfortably fit into a pocket. Many more sport digital cameras,\r\nportable music players, remote access clients and voice recorders. Imagine every portable device on your desk duct taped together\r\nand compressed to the size of a deck of cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/smartphones/NOV07consumertech8web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These devices, often called smartphones, allow businesses to communicate much faster and more efficiently. Scott Converse, director of technology programs for the executive\r\neducation department of the UW-Madison School of Business, feels that the main reason businesses invest in outfitting employees with smartphones is that it allows\r\nfunctional communication regardless of location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the constraints organizations have had is that they always needed to have their workers in one location. These devices allow\r\nyou to be outside the four walls of your building,” Converse says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all this power in such a small package, manufacturers are having issues giving users\r\na trouble-free interface, both on the hardware and software fronts. Converse believes the problem comes from the multitude\r\nof ways users need to interact with devices coupled with the fact that devices need to remain small enough to be portable.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november07/images/smartphones/NOV07consumertech5web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Today’s “mobile Internet devices” offer an Internet browser, e-mail client, messaging client and cellular phone rolled into a highly portable device that can comfortably fit into a pocket.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have a Motorola Q. It’s got an input device\r\nand a display. Both of them are too small for most people,” Converse says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few manufacturers have addressed this issue. The Samsung i760 (as well as many other Samsung smartphones) has a keyboard\r\nthat slides out from beneath the phone, allowing the device to have a larger screen without compromising portability. Apple took the high-tech route, integrating the keyboard with the display on its iPhone; the touch screen keyboard is only consuming\r\ndevice real estate when it’s in use. Unfortunately,\r\nmany smartphones use a very small, confusing keyboard and display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Converse believes that manufacturers and service providers have not taken enough steps to bring this technology out of the realm of “obscure proprietary” and into mainstream acceptance. Smartphones use a variety of operating systems which plug into a heap of wireless technologies. No two providers offer the same service set, and no two phones implement these services in the same manner. This creates a headache for application developers who, in turn, need to account for the innumerable combinations of interfaces to implement\r\ntheir application with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oddly enough, this lack of a standard interface and implementation\r\nplan has temporarily\r\nsolved an often overlooked aspect of these communication devices: security. With so many platforms to code against, hackers have been largely unsuccessful in developing anything malicious, though there have been instances of Bluetooth-distributed viruses directed at a specific operating system. As handheld operating system technology progresses, the need for actual security will increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once smartphones play along, are proven secure and give customers a user-friendly experience,\r\nConverse believes their popularity with the average\r\nconsumer will take off. Consumer-grade smartphones will (hopefully) seamlessly integrate the basic functions of our desktop computer into our pocket. E-mail, documents, instant messages and music from a home computer could, with little to no user interaction,\r\nsynchronize with a future smartphone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any flashy, buzzword-laden technology, smartphones are still slightly out of the price range of the average personal-use consumer. An entry level smartphone will set you back at least $100 and you can expect\r\nto pay up to $600 for something with serious power. This price barrier isn’t likely to stop smartphones from hitting\r\nthe pocket of the average consumer for much longer. The costs of cellular data and portable\r\ntechnology as a whole are constantly decreasing, so cellular\r\nproviders could be literally\r\ngiving smartphones away within 15 years.</p>', 'James Kadunc', 'James Kadunc is a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering and economics.', 'Timothy Lam', 'Mike Popelka', NULL, NULL),

As if choosing what college to attend and what major to complete wasn’t enough, now we’re expected to decide what to do after graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When seeking advice about life after graduation,\r\nby far the most useful resources for advice are past graduates. Although they may seem intimidating, most College of Engineering graduates are more than willing\r\nto answer any questions an undergraduate\r\nmight have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An engineering degree from UW-Madison allows for plenty of options for post-graduate\r\nwork. Three popular choices include going\r\nstraight into industry, getting a masters degree and going on to medical school—all of which have their own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Choice One: Industry</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing to work right out of college is the most popular post-graduation decision. After four to five years of undergraduate study, most students are burnt out with academia\r\nand ready to jump head-on into the career they’ve worked hard to prepare for. With U.S. News ranking the UW-Madison College of Engineering thirteenth among all doctoral-granting institutions and seventh\r\namong public doctoral-granting universities,\r\nUW-Madison graduates appear very desirable to employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan Healy graduated with a degree in industrial\r\nand systems engineering in May of 2007 and is now working for General Electric Co. Consumer and Industrial in Louisville, Kentucky. As a business team leader and materials control specialist, he says that having a busy academic schedule as well as being involved in student organizations\r\ntaught him time management skills that he now applies in his daily routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healy interned with GE for three rotations (two internships and a co-op term).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Co-ops and internships are great as far as work experience goes, but they are also fantastic opportunities to see how well you do living on your own, outside of a comfortable\r\nenvironment,” Healy says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked if he regrets the decision to enter\r\nindustry right out of college, Healy says he feels it was best for his future. “During my undergraduate career I was hesitant to attend grad school without first experiencing\r\nthe different areas that I would be able to pursue as a graduate student.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As final word of advice for undergrads, Healy says, “Look for a company that is willing to give you a lot of experience and exposure. Personally, I feel that rotational programs where you have four to five jobs over a two- to three-year period are an excellent\r\nway to increase your skill set and your knowledge base.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Choice Two: Graduate School</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Bachelor of Science graduates that want to become more focused in a particular\r\narea, getting a Master of Science degree is an excellent option. There is also the added benefit of making more money, since you are considered more valuable and in possession of more specialized knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Smith is a graduate student in the Medical Physics department with future plans to work in medical imaging. He graduated\r\nwith a bachelor’s degree in biomedical\r\nengineering and is now working on his master’s degree. He says he made the decision\r\nto go on to graduate school during his junior year when he realized that he was not learning as much as he wanted to about his specific interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduate students typically take only 12 credits per semester, but vacant time is usually\r\nfilled with research. Smith says he feels that graduate school is easier than undergrad,\r\nbut this may be because he’s taking classes focused in his specific area of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“From here on in, it’s pretty much only classes that you want to take,” Smith says. “It’s more of what you enjoy doing; if you didn’t enjoy doing it, you wouldn’t be in the graduate program.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith says a part of him wishes he had gone on to work with a company directly out of college, but these feelings only stem from seeing his fellow graduates who are already settled down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Although, the farther you go in school, the more money you tend to make, so it will eventually even out. I’ll start that life when I’m done, so I may as well get more school in now. As long as you’re not burnt out, I would suggest grad school to anyone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith’s advice for students looking to go to grad school: “Keep in mind what the requirements are for grad school earlier on so you know what to shoot for…also, make sure you’re going to (grad) school in something\r\nyou enjoy. If you have to work every hour of the day you’re not in class, but it’s in something you enjoy doing, then it’s not that bad.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Choice Three: Medical School</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some engineers, especially biomedical, attending medical school after graduation is a good next step. Medical schools look favorably on applicants with engineering backgrounds, because those students have unique premedical degrees which show that the student is willing to work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Even if you’re set on, say, cardiothoracic surgery, you’ll still have rotations in OBGYN,\r\npediatrics, emergency medicine, dermatology,\r\neverything,” Tony Wampole says, describing his future in medical school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tony Wampole is a first year medical student\r\nat UW-Madison. He was a biomedical engineer (BME) as an undergraduate and applied for early acceptance to medical school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to get into medical school, Wampole\r\nrecommends having a well-rounded resume to aid the application process. Volunteering\r\nis especially valuable, as is having\r\nworked in a hospital setting. Prospective\r\nmedical students also have to take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), which tests the prerequisite skills required for medical school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wampole says one of the most valuable skills he developed as an undergraduate was time management. Medical school classes are very rigorous and time-intensive,\r\nso optimizing time outside of class is imperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With the amount of work that the BME department has us do, especially with the night labs, you really have to work out a schedule beforehand and manage your time well,” Wampole says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical students are slowly integrated into the hospital setting, starting with a basic course during their first semester. The third and fourth year is when medical students typically start clinical rotations, gaining experience\r\nin nearly every field of medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Even if you’re set on, say, cardiothoracic surgery, you’ll still have rotations in OBGYN,\r\npediatrics, emergency medicine, dermatology,\r\neverything,” he says. “It’s not until\r\nyou graduate that you start your actual residency.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wampole’s final advice for undergraduates interested in medical school:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t freak out about grades. At least with Madison, they also look at the person, not just the GPA. You need to have good grades, but not necessarily a 4.0. And when you get to medical school … it’s all about balance.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A degree in engineering from UW-Madison is good preparation for many different paths, whether in industry, graduate school, medical school or something else. The advice\r\nfrom these three graduates, as well as that of professors and—let’s face it—even parents, is a great resource to guide engineering\r\ngraduates-to-be.</p>', 'Jaynie Sammons', 'Jaynie Sammons is in her fourth year in the industrial and systems engineering department.

But while you’ve been busily updating your highly-commercialized\r\nWindows operating system, a growing community of users has been utilizing open source software and taking advantage of features beyond the realm of what many know to be possible.</p><p>\r\nThe phrase open source refers to the sharing\r\nand manipulation of the source of a product, design or even knowledge. Open source is most commonly associated with the collection of files that translates from a readable format to what the general public sees and uses on their end—a program’s source code. Since open source code can be manipulated by the general public without repercussion, the user can expand the capabilities\r\nof a program beyond what is initially\r\nmarketed by the company.</p><p>\r\nHieu Q. Tran, Ph.D., an associate instrumental\r\ntechnologist in the Chemistry Computer\r\nCenter, is familiarized with the topic. Tran not only helps to research computing hardware and software for the chemistry department, but also helps to ensure that their interconnected network of computers runs smoothly.</p><p>\r\n“The benefits to using open source software is that it’s free … nowadays, when you buy commercial software you have to upgrade, or when a new [operating system] comes out you have to replace all your hardware and software, which can get expensive,” Tran says. “You can choose what you need and you can, depending on your abilities, modify the software to make it more efficient\r\nfor your system. And if you have time, you can modify your code and give it back to the community.”</p>\r\n<p>One recent development in the world of open source is the free productivity suite OpenOffice.org. The software is designed to be similar to Microsoft Office, but its code is available to developers who are encouraged\r\nto develop their own applications within the framework. These additions are often posted for all to use and incorporated into the next release of the suite.</p><p>\r\nTran used OpenOffice.org’s presentation software (think Microsoft PowerPoint) as an example of the power of open source software. Most students are familiar with PowerPoint’s general interface and know what it is capable of creating. But Tran explains\r\nthat the abilities of the software are vaulted into a whole different level when using open source software.</p><p>\r\n“Let’s say I prepare my PowerPoint lecture on here, and I record my voice and change the slides while running the software. So in the end I would have a movie of what I’m doing on the screen. You could make it into a lecture and post in on the web for students,”\r\nTran says.</p><p>\r\nTran also described the term “hacking” as a good thing, rather than the notorious definition\r\nthe media has attached to the term. While a hacker may be someone who gathers\r\nillegal information from computers, it is recognized amongst the open source community\r\nas someone with a vast knowledge in source code manipulation.</p><p>\r\n“The real definition that the people in the computer community like to hear is ‘hack,’ meaning you create some good things, some kind of tips or tweaking. It doesn’t always have the [negative] meaning of someone who broke into your computer,” Tran says.\r\nRegardless of what you call it, the output of open source developers is impressive. And, as Tran later added, the improvements made through the release of open source code have helped an extended audience—not just those doing the improving—because\r\nevery update is posted for all to use.</p><p>\r\nBut why would developers donate their time debugging and improving code for the general public? Tran suggests that it may actually be more selfish than it sounds. “People volunteer for that. There are a lot of young, talented people out there who are doing this … it’s like exercising your brain … and also, it’s kind of like a bragging right,” Tran says.</p><p>\r\n<b>Historical Background</b></p><p>\r\nThe label open source was first coined by Netscape on January 22, 1998 when the company announced it would make its source code accessible to the public. They released the code for their 5.0 version of Netscape Communicator Standard Edition,\r\nwhich included Netscape Navigator. Many questioned Netscape’s motives and wondered if this strategic move would hurt them in the long run.</p><p>\r\nNetscape argued that “harnessing the creative abilities of all Internet developers will be an unprecedented way to advance the features and quality of Netscape Communicator for all customers,” and hence developed a community (Mozilla.org) for developers to share their thoughts on enhancing the product. The code developed by this community was then reviewed\r\nby a group within Netscape and re-released. The product was continuously improved, due in great part to the efforts of the open source community. Mozilla.org is now home to the very popular—and open source—Firefox Internet browser.</p><p>\r\nThe Internet is arguably the best example of the value of open source. Users are able to freely gather information from sources they would not normally have access to without the connection the Internet provides. They can post information of their own, knowing that it will be shared with a broad audience. And most importantly to values of the open source culture, users are also able to interact with each other without\r\nlimitations based on location or economic status.</p>\r\n<p><b>A Dying Culture</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, Tran believes that he open source community has lost some of the momentum that it held when it initially started.  He claims this could be due to lack of funding, resulting in increased\r\ncommercialization. Redhat.\r\ncom, for example, used to be a hub for open source, hosting Linux, an open source operating system.</p><p>\r\n“The Linux on this site used to be really good and people used to pay attention to it; you could build scientific software on it, for example. But now it [has become] commercialized so the open source is no longer reliable to run my more serious software,” Tran says of Redhat.com.</p><p>\r\nIt’s hard to know for certain if the open source culture is dying out, or if commercialization is simply quieting down this once prominent\r\ngroup. But in anticipation of reaping the benefits of these computer masterminds, the general population can only hope that this community regains momentum</p>', 'Jaynie Sammons', 'Jaynie Sammons is a senior in industrial and systems engineering.

A significant\r\nboost for the climate change research community came in 2007 when this research\r\nwas recognized with a Nobel Peace Prize award.</p><p>Most of the research undertaken to understand\r\nthe factors that lead to climate change has been conducted in the oceans or terrestrial\r\nenvironment. However, a research team at UW-Madison, lead by Trina McMahon,\r\nprofessor of environmental engineering,\r\nis part of a multidisciplinary group of UW-Madison and University of Illinois researchers. The group is studying microorganisms—\r\nspecifically bacteria—that reside in natural lakes with high levels of decaying\r\norganic matter. They are searching for clues to climate change in a study funded with a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>“People appreciate fish, but not bacteria, in the lakes as bacteria are not visible. But bacteria\r\nare unbelievably diverse and have tremendous\r\ncapability to carry out biochemical\r\nreactions,” McMahon says.</p><p>Bacteria reproduce very quickly, and there are about a million more types of bacteria than there are insects. They are metabolically\r\nactive organisms and respond very rapidly to any change in climate. They also have a short life span, so the window of time in which researchers can observe changes in their community structure is short. These factors, fueled with the latest tools and techniques,\r\nsuch as DNA sequencing, enable the researchers in limnology, the study of lakes, to answer a plethora of questions about the structure of the bacterial community that might otherwise remain unanswered.</p><p>Just like the forest contains several types of trees, the bacterial community contains various types of bacteria species. The initial goal of the research is to understand the functions of the bacterial community and the structure of these communities at different\r\nclimatic conditions.</p><p>Lake ecosystems provide important resources\r\nsuch as food, water and oxygen. The primary function of the bacteria is to recycle the excess carbon present in the lakes. They also recycle chemicals that contain\r\nnitrogen and phosphorous, decompose wastes and play an important role in producing\r\nminerals that spur the growth of other organisms.</p><p>“Bacteria are the workhorses of the lakes,” Stuart Jones, a graduate student in McMahon’s\r\nlab, says.</p><p>Due to the difference in climatic conditions such as changes in temperature, light, salinity,\r\nchemicals and precipitation, the mixing patterns of lakes vary. For example, Lake Mendota mixes twice a year—once before the lake freezes and once after the ice melts. During different levels of mixing, different structures of the bacterial communities are formed. Hence, the functions of these bacterial\r\ncommunities vary with season.</p><p>The research group has recently concluded a study in the Yuan Yang Lake in Taiwan where typhoons frequently affect the lake.</p><p>Before a typhoon hits the lake, the upper portion of the lake is warm and is rich in oxygen, whereas the bottom portion of the lake is cold and lacks oxygen due to the presence of bacterial communities. With typhoon activity, the lake mixes, and new types of bacterial communities form. The most significant insight obtained from the study is that the patterns of the community prior to and after the typhoon are similar. This pattern repeats throughout the typhoon\r\ncycle.</p><p>At this point, it is clear that the structure of the bacterial community influences its function\r\nin recycling carbon into carbon dioxide gas. The climatic changes alter the pattern of the community, which introduces changes\r\nin the concentration of carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere. The changes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration influence the climate. This correlation leads researchers to draw conclusions about how bacterial community structures affect the climate.</p><p>However, it is yet to be determined how changing climatic conditions will affect the bacterial community. The bacteria may either\r\nstop performing their functions, function\r\nfaster or function differently, any of which would affect the quality of water and rate of release of greenhouse gases.</p><div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src="../FEB08/FEB07bacteria4bw.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" />\r\n<div class="caption">Professor Trina McMahon and graduate student Stuart Jones belong to a team of researchers investigating the role bacteria plays in climate change.</div>\r\n<div class="caption"></div>\r\n</div><p>One of the biggest challenges of this study is that these bacteria cannot be cultured in research laboratories.</p><p>“Bringing bacteria to labs is like growing pandas in zoos. Pandas do not like to reproduce\r\nin zoos, and they do not behave the same if their natural habitat is disturbed,” McMahon says. That is why fresh bacteria samples need to be collected during climate changes.</p><p>The group will also study the bacterial community in northern Wisconsin lakes and identify environmental factors that can change their community structure. Pumps will be used to induce mixing within the lakes. Taking weekly water samples from a northern Wisconsin lake, the researchers\r\nwill use new DNA sequencing tools to study how these quick-growing microorganisms\r\nchange in response to their environment.\r\nAnother goal of the study is to understand the interaction of bacteria with other microbes, such as algae in the lakes. The results from this experiment will be transferable, as the bacterial communities in different lakes perform similar ecosystem\r\nprocesses under similar climatic conditions.</p><p>The fundamental idea behind this research is to grasp the basic science behind natural lake ecosystems. “Once we study and understand\r\nthe system, we may be able to engineer\r\nthe system better,” McMahon says.\r\nHow would the ecosystem function if Lake Mendota no longer froze over? All we know is that the mixing pattern and the structure of the bacterial community would be different.\r\nBut how that would impact the ecosystem\r\nprocesses is a question for further research.</p><p>The damages due to global warming are becoming irreversible. “The bacterial communities\r\nof lakes can serve as a sentinel—or early warning device—signaling the impact of climate change at all geographic scales,” Jones says. This early feedback during climate\r\nchange can help us act quickly and take preventive measures before climate change moves beyond human control.</p>', 'Debjit Roy', 'Debjit Roy is a third year Ph.D. student studying industrial systems engineering', 'Natasha Benkovich', 'Cale Kasten', '2008-02-13', NULL);

However, more polymers are used in engineering designs than all three of these combined. Professor Tim Osswald of UW-Madison’s mechanical engineering department is an expert in polymer engineering and strives to teach students the engineering behind plastics.</p>\r\n<p>When speaking with professor Osswald, the origin of his accent is difficult to determine.\r\nBecause of his last name, few would guess he was raised in Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>“We come in all colors and flavors and sizes,” Osswald says. Professor Osswald came to the United States as an exchange student with a desire to learn English. He attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. After seven years, Osswald graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in mechanical engineering.\r\nHe then attended the University of Illinois\r\nwhere he earned a Ph.D. in polymer processing. He decided to further explore his interests in polymers and attended the Institute for Plastics Processing in Aachen, Germany.</p>\r\n<p>After two and a half years of postdoctoral work in Germany, Osswald began looking for an opportunity to work in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>“I wanted to go into teaching and actually Madison was my first choice,” he says.</p>\r\n<p>Osswald wanted to come to Madison for both the university and the city. UW-Madison\r\nis at the forefront of modern polymer processing and it has built a name for itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"right\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\r\n<img src=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../FEB08/P1040942_editedbyKatie.jpg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"250\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" />\r\n<div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"caption\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">Located in the newly-renovated Mechanical Engineering Building, the Polymer Engineering Center offers better facilities for student curriculum development, research\r\nand industry relations.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“In the areas of polymers and rheology, Madison is known as the cradle,” Osswald says. Fortunately, UW-Madison was able to offer Osswald a faculty position.</p>\r\n<p>Osswald says that his greatest passion is his family, but this family man shows equal dedication to helping his students. Osswald teaches many of the mechanical engineering polymer sections for the core manufacturing processes classes. He also teaches the upper level polymer classes: Design with Polymers and Modeling and Simulation in Polymer Processing. As an instructor, Osswald loves the opportunity to contribute his knowledge to the student body. In fact, his favorite part of teaching is the personal experiences with students during his office hours when he can contribute\r\ndirectly to a student’s understanding.\r\n“What I enjoy most about teaching is seeing the satisfaction on a student’s face when they get something, when you have the feeling you have taught them something\r\nnew.”</p>\r\n<p>Osswald’s students enjoy these individual\r\nlearning experiences. “He is very approachable,\r\na very nice person and easy to talk to,” UW-Madison undergraduate Travis Day says. As a well-known and respected\r\nleader in the polymer field, Osswald\r\nspends a lot of time traveling to various\r\nconferences and meetings. However, even with this busy schedule, he is still able to find time to help his students.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"left\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\r\n<img src=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../FEB08/FEB08professorprofile2bw.jpg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"250\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" />\r\n<div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"caption\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">Professor Osswald examines the molecular orientation of a soy-based protein plastic.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many experts in their field, Osswald often does litigation consultation. Osswald\r\nis unique, however, because he uses these case studies from industry as learning\r\ntools for his students. “That is where I get many of my real life examples for my class” Osswald says. He has even developed\r\na series of five minute podcasts using\r\nreal examples to discuss engineering ethics. “This is an area that we really don’t touch very much in engineering education.”</p>\r\n<p>He is continuously finding new ways to prepare his students for their future career in industry. “Osswald is constantly revising\r\nhis courses to improve their quality and keep them current,” teaching assistant\r\nSean Petzold says.</p>\r\n<p>Osswald’s enthusiasm for teaching includes\r\na desire to lead the polymer engineering\r\ncurriculum. He has written seven textbooks, including “Polymer Processing Fundamentals” and “Injection Molding Handbook.” Osswald says that one of his passions as an engineering professor “is to write the textbooks and help set the direction\r\nfor the field.” Osswald’s commitment has helped to establish UW-Madison as a clear leader in polymer engineering study worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>As a knowledgeable individual interested in molding the polymer engineering field, Osswald is also the English language editor of the Journal of Plastics Technology and an editor for the Americas for the Journal of Polymer Engineering. Though English is not his native language, Osswald’s verbal\r\nand writing skills outshine many native\r\nspeakers. He explains that he acquired these skills through “practice” and assistance\r\nfrom his Ph.D. advisor at the University\r\nof Illinois.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Osswald is also committed to advancing the polymer engineering field through research. Currently, his main focus is researching the polymers of renewable resources, also called biopolymers. These polymers are better for the environment than traditional polymers because they are typically biodegradable and are produced from renewable and sustainable resources such as corn and soybean.</p>\r\n<p>Another recent project Osswald has started may help save the lives of U.S. soldiers. He is designing non-pneumatic tires for vehicles.\r\nRather than using pressurized air, an inner structure will support these tires.</p>\r\n<p>“One of the applications is for the Humvees\r\nso that when their tire gets shot out they are not stranded,” Osswald says. Tires designed with an inner structure could prevent\r\n“flats” from occurring and help soldiers\r\navoid vulnerable situations.</p>\r\n<p>Osswald has published over 100 papers, making his research well known around the world. “He is very knowledgeable of the fields and is very well respected,” Petzold says. Unfortunately, his extensive body of work and world-renowned research once made him a target for plagiarism. In 2005, a faculty member from a foreign university completely plagiarized one of his papers. A colleague of Professor Osswald found the copied paper in an international journal. “They may have thought that it was far enough away that nobody would notice, but today with the web you can search anything,” Osswald says. The culprit was quickly dismissed from the university.</p>\r\n<p>With the recent renovation of the Mechanical\r\nEngineering Building, the dean’s office saw the need for improvements to the polymer\r\nresearch and teaching facilities. Professors\r\nOsswald, Turng and Giacomin were involved in the design of the new Polymer Engineering Center. The new center has three main functions: student curriculum development, research and industry relations.</p>\r\n<p>“Before we were crammed in various labs in the CAE building,” says Day. The new Polymer Engineering Center provides an open area for students and faculty to work, as well as consolidating all of the lab equipment\r\nto a single location. “Now we have all of our labs under a single roof … in one room that is 3,500 square feet,” Osswald says. This central hub allows polymer researchers\r\nto easily ask questions, discuss results and get assistance when needed.</p>\r\n<p>UW-Madison students and faculty are very privileged to have this center. “As far as mechanical engineering departments in the country, this facility is unique,” Osswald\r\nsays. This new facility demonstrates the UW-Madison College of Engineering’s commitment to remaining a premier polymer\r\nengineering university.</p>\r\n<p>Polymers are a relatively new engineering material and their use continues to grow as new applications and materials are developed.\r\nProfessor Osswald is working harder than anyone to teach students about the materials and mold the polymer field for the future.</p>', 'Ryan Denissen', 'Ryan Denissen is a senior majoring\r\nin mechanical engineering.', 'Matson Contardo', 'Eric Hitt', '2008-02-13', NULL),

Few people actually see this action as immoral or illegal.</p><p>\r\nThis situation plays out countless times each day and is a textbook case of copyright violation. The Recording Industry Association\r\nof America (RIAA) is currently trying to crack down on digital music piracy, mainly through lawsuits against copyright infringers.</p><p>\r\nThe RIAA has recently displayed a tendency\r\nto target college students with lawsuits. In the last year, over 1,000 UW-Madison students have received letters from the RIAA accusing them of copyright infringement\r\non university networks. Given that only around 5,000 students live in university\r\nhousing each year, this is an astonishing\r\nnumber.</p><p>\r\nThe RIAA has not definitively stated why it preys on students in the majority of copyright\r\ninfringement cases. The David and Goliath lawsuits have garnered the RIAA loads of bad press. The RIAA claims that college students are the most likely to pirate files. While this may or may not be true, it is easy for the RIAA to define who is a college student online.</p><p>\r\nInternet protocol (IP) address records cannot\r\ndefine much about the users behind them, but colleges have their own range of address space as well as well-defined records\r\nof who is using an IP address at any given time.

This means the RIAA, with the help of the university, can compile extremely accurate\r\ninformation on who is downloading what and when.</p><p>\r\nworth their while, the RIAA will file a lawsuit\r\nagainst the IP address in question. It will then subpoena the owner of the IP address\r\n(the university) for the personal information\r\nof the person using that particular address at the time the infraction occurred. With that information, the RIAA will generally\r\nattempt to settle with the person to the tune of $750 to $2,000 per song. It should be noted, though, that in cases not involving students, fines have ranged up to $250,000.</p><div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../FEB08/feb08RIAA7bw.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\"/>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Apple\\''s iPod music players, frequently used on college campuses, are popular storehouses for illicit downloads.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>A key in this process is the RIAA’s assumption\r\nthat the owner of the IP address also has information about who is using which IP address and when. In an effort to avoid liability, universities have invested hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars into making sure their systems are readily able to log user information.</p><p>\r\nUW-Madison’s Division of Information Technology (DoIT) originally stated that it would not forward copyright infraction information that it received onto students. The stance it took was that it would not do the RIAA’s dirty work in matching IP addresses\r\nto students. DoIT felt that the RIAA would not go through with the lawsuit itself;\r\nit simply wanted to settle out of court with as many students as possible. Soon, students were being sued by the RIAA, and UW-Madison found it could be held responsible if it chose not to comply.</p><p>\r\nThe RIAA recently released a document outlining its expectations of college campuses in curbing illicit file sharing. The document calls for strict Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) regarding online ethics and campus network use. The RIAA also asked that campuses carry the burden of providing legal alternatives for students, citing the student-oriented Ruckus music service as a viable option. The document went on to recommend that campuses implement a system to block peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic within its network, making the questionable assertion that the sole use of P2P networks is illegal file sharing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUW-Madison has a strict AUP regarding illicit and malicious use of its network, as well as a separate, equally verbose Copyrighted\r\nMaterials Policy. DoIT has furthermore\r\ntaken a hard stance against blocking P2P traffic within the university network. It feels that hindering illegal file sharing is not worth having to block everyone. In keeping with this hands-off approach, UW-Madison also does not promote any music service.</p><p>\r\nSo what can students do to protect themselves?\r\nEvery student should know DoIT’s policies regarding use of the campus network.\r\nThese documents are fairly long and tedious, but since virtually all students have agreed to them, it’s best to know what they entail. If you do choose to run P2P software on the university network, know that the RIAA targets students who share (read: allow\r\nfor upload) large amounts of files. Naturally,\r\nnot sharing files hinders the growth of P2P networks, so it may be necessary to decide how much is too much.

The U.S., China, France, Japan and Russia were the original founders of the organization, and 11 more countries have joined GNEP since this past September.</p>\r\n<p>“What’s so exciting about GNEP is it really attempts to address really big issues with nuclear power,” Kyle Oliver, a UW-Madison student with a B.S. in nuclear engineering who has his master’s research funded by GNEP, says.</p>\r\n<p>GNEP was created to develop and provide sustainable energy without carbon emissions or greenhouse gases and to recycle spent nuclear fuel to help minimize waste and proliferation risks associated\r\nwith nuclear energy.

In the public’s eye, the production\r\nof radioactive waste is nuclear energy’s biggest downfall. However, as Oliver says, it may actually be one of the biggest advantages\r\nnuclear energy has to offer.</p>\r\n<p>“In this mode of generating power, we get to keep the waste. It is in our possession,” Oliver says. Coal plants allow their waste (carbon emissions) to rise into the atmosphere, which is going to have enormous consequences for our environment. Nuclear energy allows us to control where the waste goes instead of throwing harmful waste into the atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>GNEP wants to make nuclear\r\npower sustainable. To do so, they are developing new ways to recycle spent nuclear fuel in a safe way. The current process used to recycle spent fuel is called Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by Extraction\r\n(PUREX). The process takes spent fuel and recycles it into three main parts: pure uranium, plutonium and fission\r\nproducts. The uranium that is recovered is enriched for reuse in nuclear reactors, and the fission products are stored in a geological repository. Many countries,\r\nincluding France and the United Kingdom, currently recycle nuclear fuel with PUREX. However, the U.S. does not because weapons-grade plutonium is produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../FEB08/BW_Core_good.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">A view of UW-Madison’s nuclear reactor core through the pool of regulating water.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, it is a big problem to be producing weapons-grade plutonium\r\nin today’s world, so GNEP has started to develop a new process to recycle spent fuel called Uranium Extraction (UREX+). The UREX+ process does not directly produce weapons-grade plutonium\r\nbecause the plutonium extracted is mixed with neptunium. This greatly reduces proliferation risks because it would be much harder to get the plutonium out of the new compound if it happened\r\nto fall into the wrong hands.</p>\r\n<p>GNEP is also trying to spread nuclear energy across the world.

The project has recently issued the first Construction and Operation\r\nLicenses to power companies. These power companies will decide by 2010 whether they will go ahead with the construction of a new reactor. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program has promised $500 million of insurance to help cover delays in construction to the first two reactors to be built. The program has also promised $250 million\r\nof coverage to the next four after that. This will help encourage power companies to build new reactors, which is an expensive and risky endeavor.</p>\r\n<p>The efforts of GNEP are encouraging and offer hope to finding a sustainable energy free of harmful emissions.

Critics of coal often cite this fuel as being excessively dirty and rather inefficient.\r\nHowever, its low cost and abundance results in its wide use. There are three coal-fired power plants on Madison’s isthmus: the MG&E power plant on Blount Street, UW-Madison’s Charter Street plant and the state-run Capitol Heating and Power facility.</p><p>\r\nSince 1958, the Charter Street power plant has provided UW-Madison with heating and cooling, performing a crucial role in the daily operations of the university. The Charter Street plant is currently facing a lawsuit from the Sierra Club and other environmental\r\ngroups over issues surrounding\r\nthe plant’s permit and maintenance practices. The suit contests that the plant did not get new permits for what plant officials state was routine maintenance—including an economizer replacement and tube replacements—which has been performed\r\nseveral times since 1996. If these items are classified as more than “routine maintenance,” a new permit is required for the Charter Street plant. This would undoubtedly\r\nbe accompanied by new emissions\r\nstandards which the plant would not meet with current technologies. The plant applied for a new permit in 1999, but it still has not been issued. In the past few years, the federal Environmental Protection Agency\r\nhas relaxed the standards of “maintenance\r\ndriving new permits,” so under current\r\nlaw the maintenance in question is not an issue. However, the Sierra Club argues that, during the time the maintenance was performed, the law required the plant to seek new permits and meet stricter emissions\r\nstandards. (Case update available at www.news.wisc.edu/14528)</p><p>\r\n“The existing [Charter Street] plant is 50 years old. The issue is: If we do go ahead and update emission controls on the existing\r\nplant, do we want to throw good money\r\nafter bad equipment … when we can install a CFB [circulating fluidized bed] facility,\r\nincrease our loads and have an even further reduction of emissions with new best-available technology?” Daniel Dudley,\r\na professional engineer in the campus utilities department, says.</p><p>\r\nCFB boiler technology is a relatively new method for producing low-cost electricity with coal and other solid fuels at high efficiency\r\nand lower emissions than previous boiler designs. In the CFB combustion process,\r\ncrushed coal is mixed with limestone and fired in a method resembling a boiling liquid, where the fuel is suspended on an upward flow of air. This causes a turbulent\r\nmixing of gas and solids, much like a bubbling fluid, which facilitates complete combustion of the fuel and provides more effective heat transfer.</p><p>\r\nUW-Madison campus power facilities need to meet three main criteria. First and foremost is reliability. Reliability means having a diverse mix of fuels to prevent reliance on just one fuel source that may be curtailed or subject to cost fluctuations. The second issue is cost effectiveness. UW-Madison’s fuel and utility bills are paid for by the taxpayers of Wisconsin, so the facility\r\nis required by state statute to buy and handle fuel for heating and cooling needs in a cost effective manner. The third issue is environmental concerns. The environmental\r\nimpact of all UW-Madison facilities, including\r\nair emissions and water management,\r\nare subject to tight scrutiny.</p><p>\r\n“Anything we do to our system has to consider\r\nthe effects of reliability, cost effectiveness\r\nand environmental impacts,” Alan Fish, UW-Madison associate vice chancellor\r\nof facilities planning and management, says. “And frankly, when you look at Charter\r\nStreet, we clearly can do a lot better in all three areas.”\r\n</p><p>This reliability is even more important on campus than it might be elsewhere.</p><p>\r\nThe physical plant team, along with a major consulting firm, completed a study about a year and a half ago which recommended\r\nthat UW-Madison move forward with a set of CFB boilers which would allow\r\nthe facility to continue to burn solid fuels—coal and biomass included—in a\r\nmore efficient state-of-the-art facility. This facility would allow diversification of fuel supplies, which would effectively increase the reliability and cost effectiveness of the plant through decreasing fuel costs and increasing\r\nelectricity generation.</p><p>\r\nA fluidized bed boiler would significantly reduce regulated air emissions compared to the current pulverized coal burning facility on Charter Street. The net carbon output, or carbon footprint, of this proposed facility\r\nstill needs to be analyzed. Even though carbon is not directly regulated today, it is a driving issue that is important economically\r\nand politically.</p><p>\r\nUW-Madison has provided the state budget\r\ncommittee with a proposal to build a new facility to replace the half-century-old plant on Charter Street, but the proposal was denied in the most recent state budget\r\npassed in the fall of 2007. The budget is written every two years. So, assuming that a CFB facility is approved in the 2009 capital\r\nbudget, UW-Madison could have power provided by a CFB facility as soon as 2012. According to future load projections, our current facilities will run out of capacity sometime in 2014.\r\n</p><p>“It does take a significant effort to build one of these [CFB facilities] so we would like to try to get this in motion as soon as possible,”\r\nDudley says.</p><p>\r\nThe contractor that conducted the proposed\r\nstudy on campus recently completed a successful CFB project in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Michigan State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Minnesota also have CFB facilities providing\r\npower on their campus. All of these facilities are located in America’s heartland which have significant agriculture resources.\r\nThese resources could potentially provide\r\norganic matter that a CFB can use for fuel as a supplement to coal.\r\n</p><p>“We believe the future is going to be some combination of solid fuel,” Fish says. UW-Madison recently received a $125 million grant from the Department of Energy to be one of three bioenergy research centers in the country. This project focuses on converting\r\nplant matter into fuel for transportation\r\nand power generation (see “Beyond Ethanol” in Wisconsin Engineer, November 2007).\r\n</p><p>“Having a state-of-the-art boiler on campus where we can test a whole variety of fuels as part of our research, on a commercial scale, is going to be another great advantage to keep us on the forefront,” Fish says.</p><p>\r\nOne obstacle is that a new facility is expensive.\r\nOne of the proposed CFB unit’s cost is in excess of $110 million. The proposed project includes two CFB units. There are also costs associated with relocation, storage\r\nfacilities and the need to dismantle the old Charter Street plant. Thus, the final projected\r\ncost of this project is in excess of $300 million. If approved, this cost would fall on state taxpayers.\r\n</p><p>“From the University’s standpoint, we want to work with the state to upgrade the 1950’s technology on Charter Street,” Fish says.\r\nDespite the high initial cost of a new plant, there are savings associated with the CFB facility which come from utilizing cheaper fuels and avoiding the need to purchase electricity from private utility companies such as MG&E.\r\n</p><p>“The study completed a year and a half ago estimated that the first 350,000 pound fluidized\r\nbed boiler, assuming both fuel savings\r\nand electricity cost, would have a rate of return of about six to eight years,” Fish says. This is very attractive considering the expected lifetime of the new facility would be in excess of 50 years.</p><p>\r\n“The beauty of the CFB is that we can burn whatever fuel is available as the most cost effective, and still meet the emissions rate reduction,” Dudley says. This equates to significant cost savings when compared to the alternative of phasing out coal plants all together in an effort to meet emission standards.\r\n</p><p>“If we were to turn the solid fuels switch off today on campus and decide we are going to burn all natural gas or oil, that’s a $30 million hit annually to our budget and essentially\r\ndoubles the fuel costs for this campus,”\r\nDudley says.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="../FEB08/Coalpower (8).jpg" width="250" />\r\n<div class="caption">The 50-year-old coal plant on Charter Street is ready for technological upgrades. Cost efficiency and generation reliability are the main goals for future projects.</div>.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are many different parties with conflicting\r\ninterests who all hold a stake in this project. The University’s steam load peaks at about one million pounds per hour, and the annual growth rate, despite conservation\r\nefforts, has been steady at about fifty-thousand pounds per hour. The University has a commitment to the taxpayers to meet this demand in a cost-effective manner. Environmental\r\ngroups will always criticize power plants for their ecological impacts; however, there is no such thing as free energy.\r\nFrom a research standpoint, building\r\nan entirely new top-notch power plant would be very exciting and would present new opportunities for energy research at UW-Madison.</p><p>\r\n“The bottom line is that we are not satisfied with the way the Charter Street plant operates\r\ntoday,” Fish says. “We believe that we can be more efficient, we can emit significantly\r\nless regulated pollutants and carbon and we believe we can be as reliable or more reliable depending on how we make an investment\r\nin the Charter Street plant.”</p>', 'Matt Stauffer', 'Matt Stauffer is a fourth year student studying materials science and engineering.', 'Ahmad Asyraf Rosli', 'Cale Kasten', '2008-02-13', NULL),

We got into the usual small talk, consisting of where we’re living and how we’re liking Madison. Inevitably, the conversation steered into what majors we are pursuing. I told her I am going for an engineering degree. At that, a scrambled look appeared on her face as she asked me, “Engineering? What do you do in engineering?”</p><p>\r\nWhen it comes down to it, what engineers do is design. But, when I look through my classes, I find few that involve the design process. This can be a bit discouraging for beginning engineering students such as myself who sit through calculus and chemistry\r\nlectures wondering, “So when do we get to build something?”</p><p>\r\nThankfully, there are student organizations out there that offer such opportunities. Among them is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</p><p>\r\nIn 2003, IEEE student members at UW-Madison\r\ncame together to design and construct their first robot, named “Oliver,” to compete\r\nin the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition\r\n(IGVC). The IGVC is a competition held each year in June, and offers engineering\r\nstudents an opportunity to get involved with the design of an unmanned ground vehicle and compete for cash prizes.</p><p>\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="../FEB08/FEB08_OnCampus1bw_ed copy.jpg" width="250" alt="Wang" />\r\n<div class="caption">"ReWIRED" was the team''s 2007 entry in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe three award categories are design, navigation and autonomous challenges. The robotic vehicle is qualified only if it is grounded (propelled by means of wheels, tracks, etc.), is within the size limits (within 3 to 7 feet long, 2 to 5 feet wide and no higher\r\nthan 6 feet) and operates without human guidance (no remote controls).</p><p>\r\nThe design challenge is based on innovative design features in the vehicle’s hardware and software. The navigation challenge assesses\r\nthe vehicle’s ability to travel from a starting point to designated destinations while circumventing obstacles such as barrels\r\nand fences. The autonomous challenge evaluates the vehicle’s ability to navigate around an outdoor obstacle course. The vehicle\r\nmust stay within the white or yellow painted line boundaries, maintain a maximum\r\nfive mile per hour speed and avoid obstacles, such as potholes and cones.</p><p>\r\nThough “Oliver” didn’t win anything in 2003, the UW-Madison Robot Team has made significant strides over the years. In fact, in 2006, they placed fourth in the design\r\nchallenge—an award worth $1,000—for their robot named “WIRED.”</p><p>\r\n“We were pretty proud of it, because everyone\r\nelse in the top five spent about $20,000 on their robot while we spent $1,500,” Jamie Tabaka, this year’s team leader, says.</p><p>\r\nConstructing a prize-worthy robot isn’t easy. There is a lot that goes into it. For instance, the design of the body has to hold a laptop, two lead-acid batteries (the same type of batteries used in cars) and power supplies. Power has to be included for the computer, the motors as well as the different sensors, all of which have different power requirements.</p><p>\r\n“We’re always working off of what we’ve learned in the past,” Ken Leedle, this year’s mechanical group leader, says.</p><p>\r\nLast year, for example, they put the batteries at the front. As a result, much of the weight was slightly forward of the front axle.</p><p>\r\n“When you’re going down a ramp [on the course], you have to control the motion very carefully. If you go too fast, the robot just tips over,” Dhananjaya Rao, this year’s embedded\r\nand electrical group leader, says.</p><p>\r\nLeedle admits that one of the downfalls of last year was that they didn’t get to do much testing prior to the competition.</p><p>\r\nTo be qualified for the competition, the group has to turn in their design report at the beginning of May. However, as the team has found out from experience, the majority\r\nof the work starts only after this design report is handed in. As Leedle puts it, that’s when the “hardcore work sessions” and all-nighters start up.\r\nOne of the reasons for the late start is that team leaders spend a good portion of the first semester training newcomers. This doesn’t leave much time for work on the robot design.</p><p>\r\n“We could probably get things [done] quicker if we didn’t spend all sorts of time bringing in new people and training them,” Tabaka says.</p><p>\r\nMany of the other teams in the IGVC competition\r\naren’t very team-oriented. Rather, they “have a professor that runs the entire show, who decides what sort of systems they’re going to buy … and [then] buys all this really expensive equipment,” Tabaka says.</p><p>\r\nThough it takes a long time to bring new members up to speed, as Zac Witte, this year’s software leader says, “… it’s worth it. The main purpose is to learn and gain experience.”\r\nWhile new members to the Robot Team learn things like the basics of writing C code, veteran members learn how to improve\r\ntheir design from past years.</p><p>\r\nThis year, the team has decided to use a new scripted interface language to remotely control\r\nthe robot. This Universal Real-time Behavior Interface (URBI) framework should offer a much simpler and more flexible method for developing a robot that can interact\r\nwith its surroundings.</p><p>\r\n<div class="left">\r\n<img src="../FEB08/FEB08_OnCampus3bw.jpg" width="250"  />\r\n<div class="caption">"ReWIRED" was the team''s 2007 entry in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nMoreover, the team members have come to realize what it takes to impress the judges.\r\n“Most of the judges are in some sort of defense-related profession, so they’re attracted\r\nto certain things that could be modified\r\nfor military applications. So we sort of pitch our design in a way that attracts them the most,” Tabaka says.</p><p>\r\nLast year, the team had a laser range finder\r\nthat shot a laser to see what object was in front of it. Having realized that this wouldn’t be good for military applications, this year they’re trying to switch to an all-passive robot that uses stereovision—the same concept by which our eyes work.\r\nStereovision is not only more militarily applicable,\r\nbut also more intelligent. The new software will allow the robot to not only react to what is directly in front of it, but rather create a map of its entire surroundings\r\nin order to figure out the best path to take.</p><p>\r\nThe team has also realized that, as Tabaka says, “the top teams that do well every year enter a couple robots into the competition.”</p><p>\r\nThus, this year the team intends to enter last year’s entry with some slight modifications\r\nand also a robot with a completely new design. The benefit of this is that it not only increases their chances of winning, but it also gives them an opportunity to experiment\r\nwith new features on last year’s robot before employing them on the new robot.\r\nThe team hopes to have a good chance this year against some of the leading competitors,\r\nsuch as Virginia Tech, who continue to dominate the competition year after year.\r\nThough the team members acknowledge that winning would be great, they’re not about to just buy expensive parts in order to win a prize. Each member has a greater reason for being on the team.</p><p>\r\nRao, for instance, has been interested in robotics for quite some time. When he saw the Robot Team as a student organization, his interest was instantly sparked.</p><p>\r\n“I was like, ‘Cool, this is something I want to do,’ so I started coming to meetings,” he says.</p><p>\r\nLeedle was part of his high school robotics team for three years. When he got to Madison,\r\nhe was excited to hear there was a robotics\r\nteam and didn’t hesitate to join.</p><p>\r\n“[You] get a lot of hands-on experience …you won’t get in your classes,” he says.\r\n“And there’s the benefit of having this on your resume,” Witte adds.\r\nSo if you’re looking for a taste of engineering\r\ndesign, join a student organization—like the IEEE Robot Team</p>', 'Victoria Yakovleva', 'Victoria Yakovleva is a second-', 'IEEE Robot Team', 'Mark Wang', '2008-02-13', NULL),
('feb08emergency', 'Campus Emergency Alerts', 'article', '', 'February', 2008, '<p>In light of the tragic Virginia Tech shootings\r\nlast spring, campuses all over the country have evaluated their crisis communication alert systems to ensure that they provide maximum security for their students. In September of 2007, UW-Madison was forced to enact their own emergency procedure system when safety on the west side of campus was threatened. While many students received news of the campus lockdown via e-mail and word of mouth, some students claim they walked home late at night from classes, work and club meetings on a deserted campus unaware\r\nof the possible dangers they faced.</p>\r\n<p>In the days following the campus threats, students and staff questioned whether the university took all of the appropriate measures and whether steps could be taken to better alert students. Talk of cell phone notifications such as voicemails and text messages started to surface.</p>\r\n<p>Following the tragedies at Virginia Tech, several startup companies specializing in mass communication alert procedures were established. These companies have the abilities to send voicemails and text messages to cell phones, phone calls to land lines and e-mails to multiple addresses of a large number of people with the push of a button.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../FEB08/Feb08_CampusAlerts_bw1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Currently, the only campus-wide emergency alert systems in place at UW-Madison are through e-mail or word of mouth.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>UW-Madison has formed a committee to address this issue and develop the best alert system for contacting students. The committee consists of Division of Information Technology (DoIT) staff knowledgeable in data and phone routing technology, John Lucas from the UW-Madison communications department who aids in press releases and the UW Police— including police lieutenant of emergency management, Joe Hornbeck. The committee met over the summer to research and begin to work out processes.</p>\r\n<p>“Over the course of time we have found ways to make the [communication] process faster. We’ve found ways to make the data better. We learned that the pool of data that we were drawing e-mail from wasn’t comprehensive enough,” Hornbeck says.</p>\r\n<p>The research committee completed a comprehensive review of its options. They began with an operation already in place: Reverse 911. This system is already being utilized by non-student residents in Dane County and it involves the Dane County Communication Center sending a call to phone numbers alerting residents of an emergency with a voice recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../FEB08/Feb08_CampusAlerts_bw3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Between staff and students’ personal and campus phone numbers, there are nearly 36,000 phone numbers that need to be enrolled in the program. Approximately 2,500 of these are entered into the Reverse 911 system each week once they have met the formatting and programming requirements. Soon, students and staff can be contacted through the system.</p>\r\n<p>Other options include installing communication devices in classrooms such as battery powered alert systems on a message screen that are controlled via FM radio waves. In the case of an emergency, radio waves could be sent to these screens, which would then light up and warn students in class. The committee has also looked into installing wireless remote speakers that can be mounted in classrooms, and sirens or PA systems similar to those in high schools. While all of these could aid in alerting students, installation, maintenance and management of the systems would be both costly and time consuming.</p>\r\n<p>“Until the crisis comes home for them [students] are just not participating,” Hornbeck says.</p>\r\n<p>Another option is text messages to students’ cell phones. However, campuses that have incorporated text messaging alert systems have experienced many difficulties. While UW-Madison has the capabilities to send these text messages, research on other campuses has shown that students are reluctant to sign up to receive the text message alerts for fear of receiving spam from the universities or due to text messaging expenses. Also, many cell phone companies may block the service assuming that such a mass operation might include spam that their customers would not want to receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../FEB08/Feb08_CampusAlerts_bw5.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The UW-Madison Police Department is one of many offices researching alternative ways to alert students and faculty in the event of a campus crisis. Current methods include sending text messages to cell phones and installing alert systems in classrooms.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another concern is that the mass text messages could lead to thousands of phone calls which would quickly overload cell phone towers.</p>\r\n<p>“If I sent ten or twelve thousand text messages out to tell you there is an active shooter, you’re going to get on your phone to call somebody, so you create this big loop within the infrastructure, and we are not entirely convinced that the infrastructure can even handle it,” Hornbeck says. “We are not entirely convinced that the system—the infrastructure for distributing text messages—will actually support the volume that we have. There are times on campus, for example football games, when everyone is on their cell phones that the system is considerably bogged down.”</p>\r\n<p>In addition to technical concerns with a mass text messaging system, there are questions of how such a plan might be implemented.</p>\r\n<p>“With text messaging, there comes a lot of policy issues. There are free systems out there, but then you get beer ads. Do you really want the number one binge drinking school in the nation to have beer ads on their emergency text messages? We can’t really do that,” says Hornbeck. UW-Madison has looked into third party vendors, but there does not seem to be any proof that these systems are infallible. The committee feels, however, that if there is a system that can support a campus of our size flawlessly, the next step would be to choose a vendor.</p>\r\n<p>There are several alert options that UW-Madison could invest time and money into. At this time, though, students must depend on e-mail alerts and word of mouth to find out about emergencies on campus. Whatever decision the committee makes, student safety will be their top priority.</p>', 'Elizabeth Grace', 'Elizabeth Grace is a senior studying English and technical communications.', 'Kristina Thomson and Anna Mielke', 'Eric Hitt', '2008-02-13', NULL);

In the wake of another grueling finals schedule, my only intentions were to relax and catch some rays. Instead, the trip presented me with the unique opportunity\r\nto pass through one of the world’s greatest\r\nengineering projects—the Panama Canal. I knew post-finals recovery was complete when I found myself curious about its design and history.</p><p>\r\nOperating since 1914, the canal revolutionized the transport of goods from one side of the world to the other. Though the convenience of a passage through Central America was realized hundreds of years earlier, the Panama Canal has yet to eclipse the century\r\nmark. Despite a seemingly simple goal, every previous design and attempt to traverse the narrow strip of land had failed.</p><p>\r\nThe ideal solution was clearly a waterway, so the French took the first crack at carving the landscape down to a sea-level canal. The effort failed miserably,\r\nas the French found themselves completely unprepared for a climate ripe with diseases such as malaria and yellow fever. France was forced to abandon the project when 22,000 workers perished in just a few years of labor.</p><p>\r\nIt was at this point a burgeoning international superpower,\r\nthe United States, threw their hat in the ring. For aiding Panama in its quest for sovereignty from Colombia, the U.S. had earned the right to take over the project in 1904 and awarded control of the canal upon its completion. President Theodore Roosevelt declared success absolutely crucial for the purpose of expanding naval power and control of the valuable land area. The engineer chosen to head the project, John Stevens, had a considerable task on his hands.</p><p>\r\nSo how would Stevens handle the position? Despite pressure to move forward with the canal, Stevens made a controversial decision shortly after work had resumed and shut down the project.</p><p>\r\nHe sent the laborers home, shifting his focus toward sanitizing the area to create a safe work environment.\r\nStevens worked with Dr. William Gorgas, who was the first to surmise that mosquitoes were the root cause of the malaria and yellow fever outbreak.\r\nTheir efforts were initially met with skepticism,\r\ndue to the dramatic increase in cost as well as the delay a work stoppage would cause. However, the two stuck by their guns and virtually rid the area of both diseases, a state that’s been maintained to this day in the canal zone.</p><p>\r\nWith the area now fit for labor, Stevens confronted skeptics once again as he altered the French design for a level canal to that of a lock system, requiring the removal of far less soil. Cost issues arose again as Stevens worked to persuade Roosevelt, eventually\r\nreceiving approval. After 10 years of construction, the Panama Canal was finally operable. The design has remained largely unaltered since, undergoing expansions only to keep up with the ever-increasing size of cargo ships.</p><p>\r\nJohn Stevens’ approach to such a complicated situation\r\nnaturally got me thinking ahead to my own upcoming engineering career. Despite the burden of a country willing him forward, he demonstrated the mindfulness to take a step back and reassess his options. This is a strategy not reserved for earth’s greatest challenges—it should be applied in everyday\r\nproblem solving as well.</p><p>\r\nStevens’ decision to halt the project until working conditions were improved was rooted in ethics as well as practicality. The move exemplified what would later come to be the first point of the National Society of Professional Engineer’s ethical code: “to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.”</p><p>\r\nAs we all witnessed in the Minneapolis tragedy this past summer, modern engineering decisions continue to have serious implications for general public welfare. Engineering is a profession in which even the smallest of details requires full consideration\r\n(undersized one-half inch gusset plates have recently been determined the critical factor in the 35-W bridge collapse).</p><p>\r\nEven at the entry-level position, the inherent responsibility\r\nthat comes hand in hand with a job in engineering cannot be understated.</p>', 'Kevin Jayne', 'Writing Editor', 'None', 'Mark Wang', '2008-02-13', NULL),

The hard disc drive (HDD) has been a staple of personal\r\ncomputer information storage since the late 1980s and has seen little change in functional, cosmetic or mechanical operation.\r\nHowever, the traditional HDD might be on the same path as the ball mouse when it meets its first major opponent in 15 years of dominance—the solid state drive (SSD).</p><p>\r\nSolid state drives have already begun to integrate themselves into the daily lives of many consumers. Whether it is a USB pen drive to transport documents or a new iPod Touch to store and play music and video, many college students are already reaping the benefits of this new storage medium.</p><p>\r\nHDDs rely on spinning magnetic platters and a read/write head to store and access information. SSDs operate by utilizing an array of compact flash memory modules to store and access information far more quickly\r\nthan traditional disc drives. Containing no moving parts, SSDs offer a plethora of unique qualities not shared with their hard disc counterparts.</p><p>\r\nThe advantages of solid state drives begin with their physical durability. Samsung claims that their SSDs can survive impacts of up to 1,000Gs—more than twice the resistance\r\nof a typical hard disc drive when not in motion (when an HDD is actually spinning, their maximum impact is much less). They are also operational in extreme climates that range from -20 to 80 degrees Celcius. Additionally, SSDs do not suffer the same type of fatal mechanical errors that so many consumers have become accustomed\r\nto when their HDD fails.</p><p>\r\nThe physical attributes of SSDs are highly intriguing to portable electronics users and those sick of replacing dying hard drives, but the most appealing and promising aspect\r\nis their sensational speed in seeking stored data.</p><p>\r\nSSDs are able to locate stored information far more quickly than HDDs because they do not need to search over a broad area of magnetic platter of often fragmented information.\r\nInstead, SSDs nearly eliminate seek times and locate information in under half a millisecond. 7200 rpm (typical of many commercial drives today) hard drives usually\r\nrequire 13 to 15 milliseconds for the same task.</p><p>\r\nSpeedy seek times result in demonstrations of high performance in real-world applications\r\nsuch as Microsoft Windows startup times. SSDs do not suffer from “spin-up” delays that traditional HDDs must experience\r\nwhen a computer powers up. According\r\nto Samsung, their 32 gigabyte (GB) model has a maximum read time 150 percent\r\nfaster than that of a traditional HDD and cuts Windows startup times in half.</p><p>\r\nLaptop owners ought to be the most excited about the introduction of solid state drives. SSDs offer the laptop user an assortment of benefits ranging from improvements in weight and heat to power consumption and noise.</p><p>\r\nOne of the major benefits of the solid state drive is its low weight; an SSD weighs roughly one-third that of a standard 2.5 inch laptop HDD.</p><p>Another benefit for SSD laptop consumers is their reduced heat and noise output. An SSD produces much less thermal energy than an HDD and requires less cooling to keep it operational and intact. In addition,it generates absolutely no noise since it does not have any moving parts.</p><p>\r\nSSDs are also very promising in the realm of battery life. The idle and operating energy\r\nconsumption of standard laptop hard disc drives is about 0.5 watts and 2.1 watts respectively. Samsung’s 32 GB solid state drive requires 0.9 watts under a full load and just 0.05 watts during idling.</p><div class="left">\r\n<img src="../FEB08/rocksolidharddrives copy.jpg" width="250" alt="asdf">\r\n<div class="caption"></div>\r\n</div><p>\r\nBut don’t toss out your old hard drives just yet! There are several reasons why the HDD is going to remain resilient in the market of consumer electronics.</p><p>\r\nThe most obvious difference between the two drives to the average consumer is the cost. Consumers have become accustomed to decidedly low prices for information storage. The going rate for 1 GB of storage on a 3.5 inch desktop hard disc drive is between\r\n$0.20 and $0.40. Currently, the price for 1 GB of storage on a solid state drive is over $10.</p><p>\r\nAnother concern for SSDs is their long-term reliability. Hard disc drives have proven to be a reliable storage medium for over a decade. Their reliability is well-known, whereas SSD reliability has yet to be determined.</p><p>\r\nSolid state drives show brilliance in seek times, portability and startup speeds. However,\r\nhard disc drives continue to show their prominence in transfer rates. Transfer rates are the speeds at which a drive can write or read data to or from the drive itself.\r\nMost tests show that 7,200 rpm HDDs boast over a 20 percent advantage in read/write tasks when sustained transfer speeds are emphasized.</p><p>\r\nCurrently, the largest capacity solid state drive available is 128 GB. This is less than half the capacity of the most spacious 250 GB laptop and 1 TB desktop hard disc drives. However, plans for larger models are in the works by several companies in the not-so-distant future.</p><p>\r\nAdvances in flash memory are finally in the spotlight and the dawn of the solid state era may soon be upon us. Questions of price, storage capacity and transfer rates will continue\r\nto loom around this exciting medium of storage but will begin to fade as technology\r\ngrows.</p><p>\r\nAccording to iSuppli, a technology market intelligence firm, “By 2010, 60% of notebooks\r\nwill have flash-enabled storage.”\r\n</p><p>While perhaps a bold claim, SSDs are here to stay.</p>', 'Matt Treske', 'Matt Treske is in his fourth semester', 'Helmi Hasan', 'Cale Kasten', '2008-02-13', NULL),

The virus, nicknamed “Motaba,” bears an uncanny resemblance to the real-life Ebola virus (EBOV). While Dustin Hoffman was able to eradicate the Motaba virus, save his ex-wife and win the day before lunch time, scientists have thus far been unsuccessful in controlling Ebola.</p><p>\r\nEBOV is a highly contagious virus known to cause a laundry list of symptoms known collectively as “Ebola hemorrhagic fever.” It kills around 85 percent of those infected and currently has no cure or vaccine; in the right conditions, it has the potential to be the deadliest virus in the world. Thus far, outbreaks\r\nhave been limited to a few parts of central Africa, so EBOV’s death count pales to those of viral heavy-hitters like Smallpox. EBOV’s severity has made it a prime candidate\r\nfor a biological weapon. Its high death rate, lack of a cure, communicable nature and one-week incubation time give it the potential to spread through a population with savage results.</p><p>\r\nResearch done on EBOV must be done in so-called “biosafety level 4” (BSL-4) facilities.\r\nBSL-4 facilities must have, among other things, extensive decontamination procedures\r\nfor all occupants, multiple airlocks for entry and exit, a low air pressure, documented\r\nprocedures for any outbreak that could occur and a highly trained staff. Only a handful of BSL-4 facilities exist in the U.S., making EBOV extremely difficult to study. The restrictions placed on BSL-4 labs hinder the research necessary to develop a vaccine. However, a team of researchers at UW-Madison\r\nis easing the restrictions by creating a less hazardous strain of the virus.</p><p>\r\n“We have a person that works in a BSL-4 lab in Winnipeg, but we needed something to work with here in Madison,” Peter Halfmann,\r\na graduate student in the UW-Madison\r\ndepartment of pathobiological sciences, says.</p><p>\r\nHalfmann and his research colleagues in the Kawaoka Laboratory have uncovered a way to effectively “disarm” EBOV in normal\r\nhuman cells. By deleting VP30, one of Ebola’s seven structural genes, researchers have been able to create a strain of EBOV virus that is only able to replicate in cells which themselves have been genetically modified to supply the missing gene. “Basically,\r\nwe took one protein out of the viral genome and made a host cell line which has the protein incorporated into its genome,” Halfmann says.</p><p>\r\nTo accomplish this, researchers modified cDNA sequences recovered from EBOV. cDNA is obtained by artificially constructing\r\nthe complementary strand of the virus’ RNA. This cDNA can then be extracted, modified and eventually re-introduced into the virus. This process is favorable because any RNA extracted has already undergone any modifications that occur after transcription\r\nfrom the main strand. As such, the RNA is in its final form, free of non-coding regions and able to code directly to proteins. Additionally,\r\nthe techniques used to do genome sequencing during development of the new virus can only be performed on DNA.</p><p>\r\n\r\nAside from its inability to replicate, the VP30-deficient virus looks and acts identically\r\nto the wild EBOV. It exhibits the same morphology as Ebola and expresses the other\r\nsix of its genes, making it a perfect candidate\r\nfor study in lower biosafety-level labs. When given the VP30 gene and allowed to grow, the new virus even exhibits the same replication behavior as the wild virus.</p><p>\r\nThe modified EBOV has shown huge promise\r\nas a basis for a vaccine as well. Though there is currently a vaccine in testing, it doesn’t directly incorporate EBOV genome. Vaccines of this nature introduce safety concerns\r\nand other complexities. A vaccine using\r\nfragments of the actual virus’ genome has the potential to be much safer.</p><p>\r\n“This [vaccine] expresses the authentic EBOV. It looks like Ebola [and] has all the genes; it just won’t replicate,” Halfmann says.</p><p>\r\nIn order to replicate the VP30-deficient virus,\r\na genetically-modified host had to be developed. Researchers inserted the genetic sequence for VP30 into a living cell’s DNA. This gave the cell the ability to create its own VP30 gene. The modified EBOV could survive and replicate in these modified host cells but in not in others.</p><p>\r\nOf particular concern to researchers is the genetic stability of the new virus. Though the genome is stable, once the VP30-less virus\r\nis introduced to a host that has been engineered\r\nto produce the VP30 gene, there is a possibility that the host cell’s VP30 genetic sequence could recombine into the virus’ RNA sequence, rendering a fully-functional,\r\nhazardous EBOV.</p><p>\r\nHalfmann says that there is “no sequence similarity for recombination to occur” and that “there is no selective pressure toward having a virus with the VP30 gene.” In short, the biological state in which the virus is developed doesn’t provide a favorable environment for recombination. Preliminary\r\ntests allowing the virus to go through a handful of generations have shown that the virus’ RNA replicates without error and the genome is thus stable.</p><p>\r\nWhile much more research must be done before the genetically-modified EBOV can be studied in lower biosafety-level labs, it appears that a slew of new possibilities are on the horizon.</p>\r\n', 'James Kadunc', 'James Kadunc is a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering and economics.', 'None', 'Mark Wang', '2008-04-09', NULL),

Any slight movement will blur the scan. After\r\n30 or so minutes of listening to a barrage of loud clicking noises that eventually mesh into a techno beat, the scan is complete. Yet, the results are unclear.</p><p>\r\nThis is the unfortunate reality of present-day Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. A breast abnormality can’t be deemed malignant\r\nor benign, a brain tumor in the center of the brain can’t be verified and the presence of a fluid around a knee ligament is uncertain.</p><p>\r\nHowever, recent strides in modern technology\r\nhave advanced the field of medical diagnoses\r\nand treatment. Some of these advancements\r\nin the field of medical imaging are currently being made right here on campus. While many engineers are looking to alternative\r\nmethods for image processing, Walter Block, professor of biomedical engineering, is seeking to improve the current methods. Adaptations of current MRI technology show great promise in producing sharper images of the body in shorter amounts of time.</p><p>\r\n\r\nMRI requires polarization and stimulation of all hydrogen atoms in a patient’s body. Perturbing the magnetization with a radio frequency signal shows the hydrogen location\r\nin relation to cell tissue. The hydrogen will return to equilibrium at different rates depending on its location in the body. These rates are processed and used to generate an image. </p><p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/APR07mri3web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">MRI equipment, such as this small limb scanner, can be updated with Block’s technology.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nMRI utilizes radio frequency\r\nenergy on the scale of meters and processes them in millimeters through encoding of special position.\r\nWhile the encoding scheme is clever, it also drastically limits how many detectors can be used to speed the scan. MRI can take one to ten measurements at a time; conversely, a state of the art 64-slice CT-scanner can take 64,000 points of data in an instant.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/APR07mri2web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Walter Block explains how new MRI technology has the potential to distinguish benign from malignant tumors.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n“With x-rays you see bone and some soft tissue…\r\nin MR you see much more contrast of tissue,” Block says. This contrast can show arteries and tissue abnormalities. However, the encoding of spatial position is what slows down the MRI process. It can take upwards\r\nof a half hour to gather enough data to produce a high-quality three-dimensional image. With time at a premium, it may make sense in some cases to accept a lower quality x-ray image.</p><p>\r\nBlock’s techniques have cut that half hour sampling time down to approximately five minutes. MRI requires generation of a three-dimensional image by taking data for every point at that image. Block creates acceleration\r\nwith his new method through under sampling of data. However, this machine is able to collect a lot more data much faster. The collected data is then processed so that clearer images are produced. “We can use computers to visualize the body in any orientation\r\nwe want. We aren’t limited to the one orientation we get with the two-dimensional images today,” Block says.</p><p>\r\nThat’s great, but what does this mean for the future of MRI? “We can take it out of the realm of the spine, knee and brain and take it into the abdomen, the heart…” Block says of medicinal advantages to his MRI process. Images are currently being produced based off of large contrast between tissues. If images\r\nare produced from finer contrast, then MRI can become a viable way of diagramming\r\nminute lesions on vital organs. As a result,\r\nhopefully MRI will be used as a means of catching certain conditions.</p><p>\r\nThe new MRI method will also play a big role in prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Current MRI can only display a lesion in a breast. Upon detection, a doctor will typically\r\ndo some sort of invasive testing to confirm\r\nif the lesion is cancerous or benign. This costs the hospital money and puts the patient under emotional and physical duress. However,\r\nBlock believes that with a higher resolution\r\nimage, a computer can use tissue characteristics\r\nto determine malignancy within seconds. Breast lesions are just the beginning of a broad spectrum of diseases for which direction\r\nand monitoring can be improved.</p><p>\r\nImaging research is moving away from pathology\r\nand shape to looking at images as a function of time or physiological parameters. “Medical images will often make a live person\r\nlook the same as a dead person,” Block says. Instead of showing images frozen in time, the faster MRI can show how the body is changing over time or reacting to treatments.\r\nTime issues with older MRI practices made this type of imaging costly and infeasible.\r\nThe newer MRI has the potential to track the development of diseases and even show how a patient’s body is degenerating over time.</p><p>\r\nOverall, Block has reformatted the process of acquiring and processing MRIs—not the hardware itself. Hospitals will not have to purchase new, expensive equipment. Faster MRI can often be implemented via a software\r\nupgrade on most MRI scanners. This is a very attractive means for hospitals to grow technologically with conservative budgeting.\r\nAs more research is done on this technology,\r\nMRI will become a useful tool in patient\r\ndiagnoses and treatment. However, as Block explains, its use and acceptance will be highly dependent on the preference of those working in the medical field. Clearly, the potential\r\nof this technology has yet to be fully realized.</p>', 'Mike Sargent', 'Mike is a junior majoring in civil engineering.

But even with Madison’s record snowfall this year, these blustery conditions feel tropical to a team of engineers from UW-Madison who recently returned from a two-month visit to Antarctica. Living in tents at the bottom of the world, where the average temperature is -31 C and the sun only shines for half the year, left these researchers yearning for the warmth of a Wisconsin winter.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003, UW-Madison was approached by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to build a drill that would collect ice cores 122 millimeters in diameter and 4,000 meters long and hopefully reveal some of the mysteries behind the planet’s climate change—UW-Madison’s Ice Coring and Drilling Services (ICDS) was born. The team of six staff engineers began work on the design for the Deep Ice Sheet Coring (DISC) drill almost immediately.</p>\r\n<p>ICDS engineers studied plans from similar projects in Russia and Europe as the basis of design but also added several new innovations of their own. Different combinations\r\nof drill rotation speeds, pump speeds and cutter configurations were examined to determine optimal drilling parameters for the DISC drill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/images/antarc1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Paul Sendelbach and Nicolai Mortensen monitor equipment that controls the Deep Ice Sheet Coring drill.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably the most important design component\r\nof the DISC drill is the drill fluid. Not only is it used as a lubricant, but it is also the exact density of the ice. This is an important feature because it equalizes the pressure pushing in on the hole which would otherwise have a tendency to collapse.\r\n</p><p>“The drill is like a long cookie cutter; it has a long tube with a cutter on the bottom.\r\nIt cuts out a whole column of ice, and after the column is about three meters\r\ninto the tube, it comes back up and the ice is pushed out of the tube,” Charles Bentley, principal investigator for the DISC drill project, says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce the drill was completed, it was sent to Greenland in 2006 for preliminary tests. The drill was then brought back to Madison for some last minute improvements\r\nbefore it was shipped to Antarctica on a C130 airplane flown by members of the Air National Guard and chartered by NSF.\r\n</p><p>“Logistics just made more sense to do the test run in Greenland. It was cheaper and closer to home, and we didn’t really care. We just needed cold ice that was about 1,000 meters deep,” Dr. Alex Shturmakov,\r\nproject manager of the DISC project, says.\r\n</p><p>The location selected for the drilling lies along the western part of the continent along the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide. Most of Antarctica is somewhat like a desert due to so little snow fall each year; this makes for ice cores with thin layers that are more difficult to interpret. At the WAIS Divide site, however, snowfall\r\nis abundant and has been that way for quite some time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/images/antarc2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">DISC project members, from left, Paul Sendelbach, Jay Johnson, Bill Mason, Dr. Alex Shturmakov, Scott Haman and Nicolai Mortensen.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>An ice divide is comparable to a watershed\r\ndivide; the divide separates opposing\r\nflow directions of ice on an ice sheet. Ice coring is typically done above ice divides\r\nto minimize potential horizontal movement of bedrock beneath the ice sheet. It is often a good idea to drill slightly\r\noff the current ice divide to ensure that migration of the divide over time does not adversely affect the ice record.\r\n</p><p>The WAIS Divide ice core will provide the first climate and greenhouse gas records in the Southern Hemisphere comparable to the Greenland ice cores. Because the time resolution and duration of drilling at the two sites are so similar, comparisons of environmental conditions between the northern and southern hemispheres is possible. Researchers will also be able to study the greenhouse gas concentrations in the paleo-atmosphere with more detail than was previously thought possible.\r\n</p><p>The drilling of these ice cores is only the beginning of a very long process. When the ice is first drilled, it is very brittle and must be handled carefully. The ice must rest to avoid cracking before being shipped back to the United States for research\r\npurposes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the cores have rested, they are shipped in special ice core boxes back to the National Ice Core Lab (NICL) in Colorado\r\nwhere NSF makes the final decision in the research process. Sections of the ice core are very expensive and also highly coveted since there is so much that can be discovered about the Earth’s climate by examining isotopes and escaped gasses from the ice.\r\n</p><p>“Basically it’s all about climate change and global warming. You can’t predict the future if you don’t know about the past, so we’re trying to get a very good record of the last 100,000 years,” Shturmakov says.\r\n</p><p>It will likely take another three drilling seasons before the core reaches its goal depth of 4,000 meters deep, and this portion\r\nof the project is complete. However, this won’t be the end of drilling excursions\r\nin Antarctica. The ICDS engineers, supported by NSF, are already making plans to prepare for drilling into the bedrock\r\nan additional 4 meters.\r\n</p><p>It could be years before any conclusions are drawn based on the ice cores from Antarctica, which is why these ICDS engineers\r\nwere hired by UW-Madison specifically\r\nfor the DISC drill project in 2003. It has become an integral part of their lives, and though they aren’t involved in the research process, it is their dedication to drilling that makes the project a success.\r\n</p><p>“We have an exceptional team of people,” Shturmakov says. “You can have excellent\r\nequipment, but the project would be unsuccessful if you didn’t have a great team of people that really live with that equipment.”</p>', 'Lynn Singletary', 'Lynn Singletary is a sophomore\r\nmajoring in civil and environmental engineering.

('apr08editorialapr08', 'If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it', 'editorial', '', 'April', 2008, '<p>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a popular idiom in the world of engineering, politics, athletics, you name it. In general, it makes sense—why worry about something that is working just fine? Yet, like expressions so often do, it has worn out its meaning over time. A recent experience of mine, however, has reminded me of what this expression really means and has, as a result, refreshed my outlook on the field of engineering.</p><p>\r\nIt began with a research study in which I participated. The study consisted of me lying in an MRI scanner for a good two hours, with my brain being imaged as I performed certain mentally aggravating tasks. What motivated me to participate—on top of the $75 pay—was my extreme curiosity about the happenings\r\nof my brain.</p><p>\r\nAfter writing my aneurysm story in the November 2007 issue, I realized how uncontrollable things in the brain are. Even if I’m doing everything right—eating healthy, exercising and so on—something can still go wrong. And, if it does, I want to know before it’s too late to fix it.</p><p>\r\nBefore the research study, I had to fill out a series of forms. Among the questions I encountered was one asking me whether I wanted to be informed if anything of concern was spotted on my MRI scan. I couldn’t believe that a box for “no” was even present. Were there people that didn’t want to know if there was something out of the ordinary about their brain? Never having been swayed by the “ignorance is bliss” proverb, I marked “yes.”\r\nOne afternoon a couple weeks after, I received an unexpected phone call from a man who was in charge of the research study. In a terribly\r\nserious tone, the man told me they recently got back my scan from Radiology and that something was spotted that was of serious concern—a cell mass in the pineal gland of my brain. It was urgent that I get it checked out immediately, he said.</p><p>\r\nThus began a month-long domino effect of chaos in my life. After weeks of phone calls between my primary doctor in Milwaukee and various neurologists, as well as a consultation and second MRI scan—both of which were scheduled during my spring break—I finally found out that I didn’t have a tumor. It turned out to be a cyst in my pineal gland—the cause of which is unknown. The cyst is currently non-threatening, but as a precaution, I was advised to get another MRI scan in six months, followed by another every year.</p><p>\r\nThough the experience was undoubtedly stressful, it made me realize how important it is to not just wait until things break. A lot of the time, people don’t draw attention to things until they do—be it a bridge, a relationship, or a part of the body. All too often we figure that if a bridge still holds cars, a boyfriend or girlfriend still lingers around, and we feel no physical pain, then everything is A-okay. Only when something goes terribly wrong—possibly irreversibly wrong—do we realize something needs to be fixed.</p><p>\r\nThough we shouldn’t worry about things that aren’t causing us problems, things are much easier fixed before they break. Aneurysms are easier blocked off from main blood flow before they’ve ruptured, tires are easier pumped with gas before they’ve gone flat and plants are easier revived before they’ve completely dried out. I’m not saying that we should over inflate tires and overwater plants, but part of making sure things run smoothly is monitoring and analyzing.</p><p>\r\nIn the world of engineering, this kind of maintenance is especially important. Though a lot of us enter the field because we enjoy building and breaking things, we can’t overlook the testing part of our job. To build something and then not regularly test to make sure everything is functioning properly would be awfully negligent. So though this part of the job may seem tedious and bothersome, we need to treat it with as much significance. That’s why there’s another important idiom—“better safe than sorry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"http://www.engr.wisc.edu/wiscengr/class/staffphotos/victoria.jpg\\" width=\\"141\\" height=\\"211\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Victoria Yakovleva\r\nWriting Editor</div>\r\n</div>', 'Victoria Yakovleva', 'Victoria is a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering.

As engineers, the importance of teamwork is regularly stressed; however, Sussman was referencing\r\nsomething slightly different. He has been working with Cerrina to discover industrial\r\napplications for a unique biological organism—the diatom.\r\n</p><p>Diatoms are unicellular algae encased in cell walls made of silicate, a form of silicon. In engineering, silicon is used in the nanofabrication\r\nof computer chips. Sussman understands\r\nthe chemistry and mechanisms behind researching the diatom’s structure, while Cerinna is an expert in the nanofabrication\r\nprocess. By combining both of their concentrated scientific backgrounds, they were able to recognize the potential use of diatoms in computer chip manufacturing.\r\n</p><p>“The chips are getting smaller and smaller and higher and higher density,” Cerrina says. However, engineering technology has already reached its smallest possible chip. The speed cannot be further increased unless a new method of production is designed.\r\n</p><p>“You can do it yourself and that is what we are doing today. You develop the techniques\r\nyourself and make things smaller and smaller… Or you can take something that already knows how to make small things and use it as a tool,” Cerrina says.\r\n</p><p>“Synthetic biology. Let’s assume that we know system biology. Can we use that to build new things?” Cerrina says of how the idea was initiated. These diatoms are able to “make little machines—little structures in dimensions that engineers have trouble with,” Sussman says. “We are hoping that we can discover how they do that.”\r\n</p><p>“No one has been able to genetically modify\r\n[the diatoms], to manipulate them and use them,” Sussman says. When a team at the University of Washington was able to sequence the diatoms, Sussman knew he was part of an amazing research project.\r\n“This group of organisms is so far out there,” Sussman says. “In this case, prior information is useless.” The diatom is the first silicate-requiring organism that has ever been studied.\r\n</p><p>How exactly did this discovery take place? Cerrina, Sussman and their teams built a microarray synthesizer to make DNA chips. Then they decided to starve the organisms of silicate to see which genes get turned on and which get turned off. It is “an easy way to figure out which genes are involved in the [nanofabrication] process,” Sussman says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe organisms were similarly starved of nitrogen, carbon and other important components\r\nthat have been previously studied on known systems. “Out of the 10,000 genes, 2,000 genes were affected by one of those conditions,” Sussman says. “Out of the 2,000 genes, we identified 75 genes that were specifically impacted by silicate starvation...\r\n67 of them have no sequence seen before.” Since this is the first researched organism\r\nthat requires silicate, they think an entire world of silicate chemistry is yet to be discovered.\r\n</p><p>A second investigation performed at UW-Madison was to find out where in the cell the genes specific to the silicate process exist.\r\nIt is hypothesized that they are in the cell wall since this is the silicate’s location. In order to test the theory, the diatom protein\r\nwas modified by fusing half with a glowing jellyfish protein.\r\n</p><p>“It glows in the cell wall,” Sussman says. “We are going in the right direction.” Next on the agenda is to mutate the genes, create\r\nimperfect cell walls and overexpress the organisms to see how they react, a process known as “reverse genetics.”\r\n</p><p>What about these possible computer chips that may be formed by “reprogramming” the diatoms? In what kind of computer will they be used? “It is not going to be a computer in the way that we know a computer,”\r\nCerrina says. “[The diatoms] will be nanofabricators… The plan is to teach these diatoms to fabricate the shape that we want, not the shape that they want.” The process is analogous to taking a machine that is designed\r\nto make sunglasses and reprogramming\r\nit to create reading glasses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/images/diatom2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Located in the NanoTech Lab, the microarray synthesizer is an essential instrumentation device for researching the specific genes of diatoms.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are trying to make biological systems to mimic engineering systems,” Cerrina says. “We are trying to find the set of instructions\r\nto make the diatom work.”\r\n</p><p>Finally, the scientists will want to modify the diatom’s set of instructions for purposes\r\nof computer chip production.\r\n</p><p>“It’s a new time that requires collaboration.” Natural science needs people who are comfortable\r\nin thinking outside of their own area. “Engineers are very good at this,” Sussman says.</p>', 'Sally Green', 'Sally Green is a junior in chemical\r\nengineering.

('apr08band', 'The new rock stars', 'article', 'Making big noise on campus', 'April', 2008, '<p>As snow falls heavily outside, UW-Madison senior Erik Sua sits on his living room couch, fixing the broken pedal of his bass drum. After the screws are tightened and the pedal is repaired, he’s ready to start the jam session. Sua tosses a microphone\r\nto his friend Keri, hands me a guitar and before you know it, we’re rocking out to “Say it Ain’t So,” by Weezer.</p>\r\n<p>We’re not an aspiring garage band running through our favorite 90s hits; we’re just playing “Rock Band,” an interactive musical video game. In the game, players imitate actual musicians by playing\r\ninstrument-shaped controllers, including drums, guitar, bass guitar and vocals. Released last fall, “Rock Band” is very similar to its older sister game, “Guitar Hero,” except that “Guitar Hero” has only guitar parts. In both games, colored bars that stream across the screen indicate which notes to play and when to play them, requiring players to have good hand-eye coordination, timing and dexterity. Real musical talent, however, is optional. As Sua says, “Playing ‘Rock Band’ will make anyone think they can sing.”</p>\r\n<p>“Rock Band” and the recently released “Guitar Hero III” are huge hits on college campuses—and not just among traditional “gamers.”\r\nThe unique style of interactive play appeals to nontraditional video game players as well. According to Sua, the final push for him to buy the game came from the idea that he could get his introverted\r\nfriends to sing in front of others. Though both games are similar in play, “Rock Band” tends to be a “better party game” because\r\nit incorporates more players and more instruments.</p>\r\n<p>“Rock Band” is more or less an expansion of “Guitar Hero,” sharing\r\nthe parent company Harmonix, under which “Guitar Hero I” and “II” were released. Last year, however, the “Guitar Hero” name was bought out by Activision Inc., which then released “Guitar Hero III” in competition with “Rock Band” last fall. Despite shifting\r\nownership, neither game has strayed much from the format introduced in the previous versions of “Guitar Hero,” including similar controls, set-up and mode of play.</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april08/images/guitar.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">UW-Madison senior, Erik Sua, develops quick (and sore) fingers through a healthy dose of “Rock Band.”</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The changes that have been made, though, reflect the blurring lines between the music industry and the video game industry. After the first two “Guitar Hero” games grossed over $360 million, record companies finally recognized the potential of these games to help salvage plummeting record sales. While the songs on “Guitar Hero I” and “II” were almost exclusively covers of famous\r\nrock songs, “Guitar Hero III” and “Rock Band” feature nearly all original\r\nrecordings licensed by the record companies, with artists ranging from the Rolling Stones to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Furthermore, Metallica, a group who has been especially vocal against illegal file sharing in the past, will debut\r\na new song on the next version of “Rock Band.”</p>\r\n<p>Another key factor that influences the soundtracks is each game’s emphasized style. According to UW-Madison sophomore Jon-Erik Jepson, “‘Guitar Hero III’ places more emphasis on rhythm guitar instead of lead guitar,” meaning fewer face-melting solos and more melodic jams. For Jepson, “Guitar Hero II” features the best songs, which makes it his favorite version of the game.</p>\r\n<p>“The song selection definitely affects how much I like the game, seeing as ‘Guitar Hero I,’ ‘II’ and ‘III’ are basically the same exact game except for the songs on them.”</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, Sua says that the multi-instrumental format of “Rock Band” has led to songs with “sections that emphasize vocals more, or bass guitar, or drums,” rather than just guitar. This allows for a greater range of songs, making\r\nup what Sua considers a “more enjoyable song selection” than the “Guitar Hero” games.</p>\r\n<p>If players are looking for more songs, they’ll find them available online. For “Rock Band,” the songs are around $1.99 each to download, as are “Guitar Hero” songs, although actual prices can vary. It may not seem like much, but the costs can add up quickly for avid fans of the game.</p>\r\n<p>“The songs can get pricey to download,” Sua says, adding that he’d like to see more affordable choices with the next version of “Rock Band.” Jepson agrees and says that a larger database of songs would be convenient.</p>\r\n<p>Until new versions are released, however, Sua, Jepson and other college students\r\naround America are content with current versions of “Rock Band” and “Guitar Hero.” Living the life of a rock star from the comfort of a dorm room has never been so easy or so fun. But students who play the game better watch their habits; as Jepson jokes, “Above all, ‘Guitar Hero’ is a great way to waste time.”</p>\r\n', 'Carrie Boecher', 'Carrie Boecher is a sophomore majoring in civil and environmental\r\nengineering.', 'Tom Moran', 'Eric Hitt', '2008-04-09', NULL),

How was this rapid onset of e-business and e-commerce going to affect the way we do business? Should we even worry about it? Looking at the landscape of the present day, the answer is obvious.</p><p>“[Companies] intuitively knew this was something that was going to transform their industry. They did not know to what extent, but knew it would be big,” Raj Veeramani, a founder of UW-Madison’s E-Business Consortium,\r\nsays.</p><p>\r\nAround this time, Veeramani and his colleagues\r\nqueried ways in which UW-Madison\r\ncould lend its vast resource and research\r\nbase to help industry find the role e-business would play in their future. Their answer was in the E-Business Consortium, currently in its tenth year of operation.\r\n</p><p>“[UW-Madison] deals with issues in a holistic\r\nmanner and provides an unbiased point of view.” With the competitive nature of industry, finding someone to call an ally is not easy. “As a university we provide an unbiased view. People feel the info they are hearing is the best,” Veeramani says.</p><p>\r\nAt the time, each company had been trying\r\nto utilize the web in different ways. As these companies began talking with each other, they realized all these different industries could learn from one another. “There were a lot of issues and pressures to which answers were not known. The consortium\r\nwas a way for industry to tap into the intellectual capital of the university,” Veeramani says.</p><p>\r\nBut what could an energy provider learn about business practices from a shoe distributor?\r\n“That is what is unique about the consortium. It is a collaborative, non-competitive\r\nenvironment,” Lisa Bruckschen, a graduate student majoring in industrial engineering\r\nat UW-Madison, says. Her focus area for the consortium is the Supply Chain Management Group—one of five divisions.</p><p>\r\nThe company’s fields are all across the board. “We have manufacturing, telecommunications,\r\nservice, distribution and many more. We bring them together and facilitate\r\nthe exchange of knowledge and best practices related to emerging technologies and e-commerce,” Bruckschen says.</p><p>\r\nOther focus areas of the consortium include sales, marketing and customer service, IT strategy and information security, web strategy and marketing, and radio frequency\r\nidentification (RFID).</p><p>\r\nThe heart of the consortium is the peer group meetings, which number over 50 every year and are conducted for the five focus groups. Early on, the consortium also decided to take on a more regional focus so that all companies were able to attend the peer group meetings.\r\n</p><p>“The peer groups are how we fulfill our mission and promise,” Veeramani says. “Peer groups bring companies together on a regular basis to engage and facilitate discussion\r\nsessions. They learn how different companies are doing things. The meetings are very valuable to participants and a portion\r\nof the meeting is more open forum. Companies can pick the brains of others. They tend to be very practical types of discussions,\r\nnot academic. The hope is that everyone\r\nwalks away with actionable ideas.”</p><p>\r\nActionable ideas are exactly what it will take to be successful in the coming decades, regardless of a company’s specialty. The newest\r\ngeneration of college graduates must be prepared to tackle the challenges of a globally interconnected market place. Being able to adapt to rapid onsets of change will require the constant regeneration of knowledge and best practices, and the UW-Madison E-Business\r\nConsortium sets out to assist in that process.\r\n“It is the cross pollination of ideas, and the wisdom of the group that allows companies\r\nto climb the learning curve,” Veeramani says.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Carter Franz', 'Carter is a sophomore studying\r\ncivil engineering.

Students broadened their awareness\r\nof the challenges different countries face, while simultaneously expanding their perspective. Although UW students were still on a college campus much like UW-Madison’s, they were able to experience the laid back Cape Town culture. “[They were] very inviting people, and [we realized] that humor is the same in every country,” Steenblock\r\nsays.</p><p>\r\nThe program is currently looking at the outcomes of this past trip and analyzing how the students benefited from working abroad in order to determine whether another\r\nconference will be held overseas.

Behind\r\nme was a myriad of quaint Madison homes;\r\nin front of me was a stone bridge that links\r\nthe manufactured world of suburban expansion\r\nto a world of environmental beauty.\r\nAlthough it was cliché, I searched for\r\nTom Petty’s “Runnin’ Down a Dream” on\r\nmy iPod. My run through the Arboretum\r\nallowed me to experience some of Madison’s\r\nfinest wetlands firsthand. The next\r\nmorning, in my fluid mechanics lecture,\r\nI was still pondering my existential run. I\r\nwanted to know more about the wetlands.\r\nMy eccentric professor, Chin Wu, pointed\r\nme in the direction of his knowledgeable\r\ncolleague, Ken Potter. Several hours later,\r\namidst ambient jazz music, Professor Potter\r\nand I eagerly discussed Madison’s wetlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wetland is typically a low-lying portion\r\nof land that is saturated with water. During\r\nperiods of excess rains or flooding,\r\nwetlands will become saturated and form\r\ntemporary ponds. “Some wetlands become\r\nponds because rainwater has filled them up.\r\nEven if you drain them into another system\r\nyou will have flooding,” Potter says. A recent\r\necological problem has stemmed from\r\nwetlands turning into permanent ponds.</p><p>\r\n\r\nPotter noted a common misperception regarding\r\nwetlands. While they do absorb\r\nexcess waters, they are not a true filtering\r\nagent. “Water comes out of the wetlands\r\npretty clean because it’s falling out of the\r\nsky pretty clean…if you add nutrients from\r\nagriculture, that begins to dirty up the water,”\r\nPotter says.</p><p>\r\nMost people acknowledge wetlands as a\r\nvirtual dumping site for rainwater deposits\r\nsuch as winter road salt and sand, crop and\r\nplant pesticides, and excess sewage waters.\r\nAlthough I couldn’t see it during my run,\r\nMother Nature was hard at work absorbing\r\nmankind’s messes. “It’s one of those things\r\nin our society…we have to protect it, but no\r\none’s really clear why,” Potter says.</p><p>\r\n\r\n<div class="right">\r\n<img src="../september08/images/SEPT08wetlands1web.jpg" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\">\r\n<div class="caption">The wetlands provide numerous services for people and wildlife, such as this whitetail deer.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe insatiable American desire for growth\r\nis pushing our population into every corner of the country.

Despite\r\nour advancing society, we still have\r\nto manage rain and flood water. With more\r\nimpermeable surfaces, water has less viable\r\nplaces to travel.</p><p>\r\nThe way material deposits in the wetlands\r\ncan greatly affect how wastewater is absorbed\r\nand filtered. “The most damaging to\r\nwater quality in the Midwest are sediments\r\nand nutrients,” Potter says. By continuously\r\ndumping sediments in the wetlands, we\r\nare promoting the germination of invasive\r\nplant species, which serve to choke out beneficial\r\nnative plants.

Encouraged\r\nby the article, he attended an information\r\nsession that semester. Afterward, he felt\r\ninspired to help those less fortunate using\r\nwhat he had learned as an engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time in EWB, Lee has worked\r\non the Rwanda project. Rwanda, a small\r\ncountry in east central Africa, is highly\r\npopulated, with more than nine million\r\nresidents. Due to the hilly terrain and lack\r\nof centralized water systems to carry clean\r\nwater and sewage, obtaining drinking water\r\nis a major problem. As a result, villagers\r\noften must walk several miles for water—\r\nmuch of which is untreated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After two years with EWB, Lee went on his\r\nfirst assessment trip to Rwanda in the summer\r\nof 2007 as the project manager. He was in charge of three teams, each specializing\r\non unique projects in a small village called\r\nMuramba. All three projects—fuel board\r\ncutting, rainwater catchment and bio-sand\r\nfiltering—targeted the water and fuel shortage\r\nproblems in Muramba.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../september08/images/SEPT08OnCampus4web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Julia Wagner shows off a prototype\r\nfor a stove for the Rwanda project.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The bio-sand filtering plumbing system is\r\ndesigned to carry water through layers of\r\nrocks and sand so that the sediments can\r\nbe filtered. One of the clever designs of this\r\nfilter is the diffusion plate on top, which\r\nultimately allows harmful biological substances\r\nto be digested or decomposed. As\r\na result, the water that comes out from the\r\nplumbing system is nearly ready for consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their time in Muramba, the EWB\r\ngroup was deeply involved with the local\r\npeople. In their assessment trip, they sat\r\ndown and discussed with the community\r\nwhich projects they thought were most\r\nneeded. “They bring in the construction\r\ntechniques, and we have the designs and\r\nfunding,” Lee says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of their primary projects was the\r\nrainwater catchment. In this project, they\r\nworked side by side with a vocational\r\nschool in the village. With the help from the\r\nlocals, they built a gutter system which collects\r\nand leads water from rooftops to two\r\nsmall tanks. Once the small tanks are full,\r\nthe overflowing water collects in a large\r\ntank, leaving the sediments at the bottom\r\nof the smaller tanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EWB projects answer the call for help, both\r\nfinancially and educationally, and make\r\ninvaluable contributions. The team is able\r\nto apply the basic knowledge and skills\r\nrelated to engineering directly to a society.\r\nAlthough the designs are relatively simple,\r\nwhat the EWB team has done in projects\r\ncan benefit communities significantly for\r\nyears to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those interested in joining EWB, the\r\ngroup looks for responsibility, passion and\r\ntrustworthiness in their potential members.\r\nThe group is one of the fastest- growing\r\norganizations on campus and is always\r\nlooking for opportunities to expand.

Of paramount importance\r\nto these advances is the technological progress\r\nmade in the composition and application\r\nof asphalt.\r\n</P><P>\r\nIn general, asphalt concrete consists of an\r\naggregate bound together with a petroleum-\r\nbased “asphalt binder.” To create a\r\nroadway out of this material, layers are laid\r\ndown at a temperature of approximately\r\n150 C and compacted. The resultant material\r\nis relatively inexpensive, durable, quiet\r\nand quickly ready to support traffic.\r\n</P><P>\r\nWhile this process has been highly refined,\r\nit does not produce flawless roadways.\r\nStress from traffic, freeze/thaw cycles\r\nand road salt produce cracks, ruts and, of\r\ncourse, potholes. Furthermore, petroleum\r\nrefineries that produce asphalt do not spend\r\nmuch on asphalt research. In fact, asphalt is\r\nnot particularly profitable for refineries to\r\nsell; it is simply a byproduct of the refining\r\nprocess.\r\n</P><P>\r\nThe UW-Madison Modified Asphalt Research\r\nCenter (MARC) is searching for\r\nways to make asphalt cheaper, safer and\r\nmore environmentally friendly. According\r\nto Codrin Daranga, associate researcher in\r\nthe MARC lab, the possibilities for creating\r\nasphalt tailored to the specific needs of a\r\ncertain project are endless. “The goal is to\r\nmake the best of the cheapest, most environmentally-\r\nfriendly materials”.\r\n</P>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../september08/images/APRIL08ASPHALT4WEB.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Asphalt, a byproduct of the refining process,\r\ncan have a variety of substrates to\r\nmodify its properties.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\nDaranga says the key is considering every\r\nvariable that goes into a particular paving\r\nproject and formulating an asphalt to fit\r\nthose conditions. Climate, type of roadway,\r\nroad closure time and environmental\r\nimpact all play a role in this decision. The\r\nmost common asphalt modifications include\r\nadding polymers to the mix, modifying\r\nthe temperature the asphalt is laid at or\r\nemulsifying the mixture to remove the need\r\nfor heating altogether. As of now, there is no\r\ncookie-cutter answer to these design problems\r\nand no perfect asphalt mix.\r\n</P><P>\r\nYears ago, researchers developed the first\r\nmethod for assessing the properties of asphalt.\r\nIt involved a small sample of asphalt\r\nand a person willing to chew on it. The\r\nMARC, on the other hand, employs cuttingedge\r\ntechnologies to evaluate an asphalt\r\nsample’s properties. Researchers employ\r\nheat testing, artificial weathering, impact\r\ntesting and any other means of abusing asphalt\r\nto quantitatively measure how much\r\nstress asphalt samples can withstand. Tests\r\nfor flash point, viscosity and volatile organic\r\ncompound content measure the ability\r\nof modified asphalts to be transported and\r\nlaid easily and safely.\r\n</P><P>\r\nThe overriding obstacle that often prevents\r\nthe optimal asphalt from being laid on a\r\nroadway is cost. Like most large-scale processes,\r\nmoney is the biggest consideration\r\nin a design decision. Diverting traffic, shipping\r\nmaterials and labor costs are all expensive\r\npropositions. In many cases, engineers\r\ncan modify asphalt formulas to minimize\r\nthese costly issues.\r\n</P><P>\r\nSince asphalt is a product of oil refining, the\r\nprice of asphalt all comes down to the price\r\nof crude oil. Given that material transportation,\r\nwhich also depends on the price of oil,\r\nis a large component in asphalt costs, the\r\nability to extend the longevity of our roads\r\nwill become an enormous issue as the price\r\nof oil continues to rise.\r\n</P><P>\r\nTo aid in safe and effective cost reduction,\r\nresearchers are looking to further the viability\r\nof so-called “warm mix asphalt concrete”\r\n(WMA). Heating standard, “hot mix”\r\nasphalt to the temperature needed to lay it\r\nrequires enormous amounts of heat. Since\r\nasphalt contains volatile compounds, this\r\nprocess also releases noxious vapors which\r\ncan be hazardous. Though WMA technology\r\nis fairly new –- having been introduced\r\nto the US in 2002 –- 30 to 50 C temperature\r\ndrops have already been demonstrated,\r\nalong with sizable reductions in volatile vapor\r\nand greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n</P>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../september08/images/APRIL08ASPHALT3WEB.jpg" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Codrin Daranga of the UW-Madison\r\nMARC tests the force needed to break\r\nan asphalt sample.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\nThe MARC’s advances in asphalt composition\r\nand testing are making a formidable\r\nimpact on the asphalt industry.

What have I done?\r\n</P><P>\r\nSo I weighed my options. But I realized that\r\nmy arm probably wouldn’t fit in that mail\r\nslot, and I didn’t think the building manager\r\nwould fully understand the gravity of\r\nmy situation. So I let it be. I was locked in…\r\nNo more gameday tailgates? No more 5th\r\nQuarter? No more Grateful Red or Crease\r\nCreatures?\r\n</P><P>\r\nBut how bad could it be?

For example:\r\nno more 20-page lab reports, late nights at\r\nCAE, dinners at the ECB vending machines,\r\nor assignments due in lecture three days a\r\nweek. In addition, returning to Madison as\r\nan alumnus still affords you many of the\r\nsame privileges. Tailgates, the terrace, and\r\n“Jump Around” were just as exciting during\r\nmy weekend visit for the Badger football\r\nwin against Marshall.\r\n</P><P>\r\nAmong all of the life changes since graduation\r\nin May, one of the most noticeable for\r\nme came the first week in September. For\r\nthe first time in 18 years, I spent the week in\r\nmy office, instead of the classroom. Another\r\nbig change, I didn’t spend a single night in\r\nWisconsin Engineer office, working in front\r\nof a computer screen plastered with Adobe\r\nInDesign files. Instead, the magazine staff\r\noffered me the chance to write my very first\r\neditorial.\r\n</P><P>\r\nInstead of using this opportunity to reflect\r\non my past five years at Madison, I think the\r\nbest way for me to thank UW-Madison, the\r\nCollege of Engineering and Wisconsin Engineer\r\nfor all of the wonderful memories is\r\nto pass along a few things that I’ve learned\r\nalong the way. Seeing as this is the September\r\nissue and the magazine is stuffed full\r\nof recruitment ads from General Electric,\r\nJ.F. Ahern, General Mills, and many, many\r\nmore; it only seems fitting that I offer my\r\nadvice to those of you heading to the Fall\r\nEngineering Career Connection.\r\n</P><P>\r\nSo, am I even qualified to offer advice? Why\r\nshould you trust me? Well, I’ve attended\r\nnearly every career fair dating back to the\r\nfall of 2003 (scary moment, I just realized\r\nhow old I am), and, at one point in time,\r\nI was a student looking for an internship,\r\nco-op, or full-time employment. Last year\r\nat this time, I had my first interview for the\r\ncompany I now work for, Integrys Energy\r\nGroup. However, experience alone certainly\r\ndoes not make me an expert—so instead,\r\nlet’s title this piece: Three secrets to career\r\nfair success.\r\n</P><P>\r\n1) Practice. The easiest way to develop a\r\nroutine and get comfortable talking with\r\nrecruiters is to practice. Not in the mirror—\r\nin person. You aren’t trying to get a job with\r\nevery company at the career fair, so use that\r\nto your advantage. Build confidence at the\r\nbooths with the free flashlights and key\r\nchains first, and then shift to the big companies\r\non your list. With only a few minutes\r\nto make your impression, better preparation\r\noften leads to better results.\r\n</P><P>\r\n2) Research. Anyone can Google search a\r\ncompany name. For example, you might\r\nnot make the best impression with the question,\r\n“I read you’re into machine design,\r\nwhat’s that like?” Instead, consider searching\r\nthe company website for the job posting\r\nyou are interested in or that of a similar\r\nposition. This allows for a more informed\r\ndiscussion with the recruiter and helps reduce\r\nthose awkward pauses.\r\n</P><P>\r\n3) Listen. This is probably my favorite tip\r\nbut also the most difficult. We often spend\r\nso much time rehearsing what to say that\r\nwe forget to pay attention to the response.\r\nAll of the noise and commotion in the ECB\r\nlobby makes this even more challenging.\r\nMy solution, take notes. Not only does\r\nthis helps convey your interest, but also allows\r\nyou to record important information\r\nprovided by the recruiter. In recent years,\r\nmany companies will take your resume\r\nand then rattle off a list of instructions on\r\nhow to apply on their website. While you\r\ndon’t want to lose all eye contact with the\r\nrecruiter, having a notepad is a surefire way\r\nto stay focused though the chaos.\r\n</P><P>\r\nThere you have it. Practice, research, listen.\r\nNot exactly “secrets,” but hopefully\r\nsome useful advice from someone who has\r\nbombed a time or two. Remember, Career\r\nConnection is just one the many ways to\r\nfind a job, so don’t get discouraged if you\r\naren’t successful on your first trip.\r\n</P><P>\r\nFinally, one quick plug for Engineering\r\nCareer Services.

('sep08electronicelect', 'The  Electronic Election', 'article', '', 'September', 2008, '<p> It’s Thursday night and I’m at the library.\r\nWhile my friends are at home, kicking\r\noff their weekends with “Grey’s Anatomy”\r\nand “The Office,” I’m stuck battling\r\na mountain of assignments and regretting\r\nevery minute that I wasted this week on\r\nFacebook, Instant Messenger and YouTube\r\ninstead of studying. </p> <p> Suddenly, my phone buzzes and glows\r\nblue. Text message! It’s probably my\r\nfriends, trying to convince me to give up\r\nthe homework and come out with them.\r\nOr maybe it’s my roommate asking if I’m\r\ninterested in lunch tomorrow. I let the scenarios\r\nbuild up in my head, and when I’ve\r\ncreated enough suspense for myself, I flip\r\nthe phone open.</p> <p>\r\nMy hopes drop. It’s just from Barack\r\nObama. “Watch Barack debate tonight on\r\nABC!” it says.</p> <p>\r\nWhile receiving a text from one of the\r\nmost prolific figures in the country might\r\nseem like a momentous occasion, it’s the\r\nthird one I’ve gotten from Obama today.\r\nAs part of the Obama Mobile campaign,\r\nI, along with thousands of other Americans,\r\nhave been receiving texts reminding\r\nme of Obama’s television appearances and\r\ndebates for over a year. On the day of the\r\nWisconsin primary, I received no fewer\r\nthan five of these messages reminding me\r\nto go out and vote.</p> <p>\r\nObama isn’t the only candidate who has\r\nutilized text messaging in his campaign;\r\nHillary Clinton and John McCain have\r\nused similar systems of text messages and\r\ne-mails to keep supporters informed and\r\nactive—and this is just the beginning. From\r\nsocial networking sites such as MySpace\r\nand Facebook to media sharing sites like\r\nYouTube, technology has played a bigger\r\nrole in the 2008 presidential election than\r\nany before it.</p> <p>\r\nWith virtually unlimited access to information\r\nand conversation, it would seem\r\nas though this generation of voters should\r\nbe the most informed. Although it may be\r\nuncertain whether vast online involvement\r\nwill translate into real votes, students are\r\noptimistic.</p> <p>\r\n“I think that Facebook has made everyone\r\nmore aware of the candidates,” Ted\r\nMessner, a UW-Madison sophomore, says.\r\n“And I think that the increased knowledge\r\nwill lead to a significant increase in voter\r\nturnout.”</p> <p>\r\nUW-Madison sophomore Emily Hosek\r\nsays, “I feel like one of the biggest excuses\r\nfor people not voting in the past is that they\r\ndidn’t want to make an uninformed choice.\r\nBut, with the internet, all of the information\r\nis so accessible all the time.”</p> <p>\r\nLearning about a candidate’s position on\r\nan issue has never been easier. All of the\r\nmajor candidates have extensive websites\r\nlaying out their platforms issue by issue.\r\nWith the click of a mouse, computer users\r\ncan see Hillary Clinton’s plans for education,\r\nJohn McCain’s goals for health care\r\nand Barack Obama’s ambitions for foreign\r\npolicy.</p> <p>\r\nThis easy access to candidate’s policies\r\nhelped Hosek, who is especially interested\r\nin the environment, make her voting decision\r\nfor the Wisconsin primary.</p> <p>\r\n“Before the primary, I just pulled up the\r\nObama and Hillary websites and I compared\r\ntheir environmental policies side by\r\nside. It only took about 10 minutes total.”</p> <p>\r\nWhile these campaign websites have certainly\r\nmade the political information more\r\naccessible, it’s social sites like Facebook\r\nand MySpace that have really revolutionized\r\nthe election process. In particular, they\r\ngive candidates the opportunity to play up\r\ntheir personal images. On their Facebook\r\nprofiles, for instance, candidates list their\r\ninterests and religious views, as well as\r\nfavorite books, movies, music and quotes.\r\nIn addition to allowing viewers to observe\r\nsimilarities between themselves and the\r\ncandidates, these profiles make the candidates\r\nmore accessible and human. For\r\ninstance, I found it interesting that Obama\r\nand I both list Bob Dylan among our favorite\r\nmusical artists, and that John McCain\r\nand I both enjoy hiking in our spare time.</p> <p>\r\nMore than simply presenting candidate\r\ninformation, these sites act as a forum for\r\nusers to discuss, debate and dissect the issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../september08/images/election.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">[The internet offers a highly accessible means of receiving campaign updates.]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“The internet lets people from all over the\r\nworld talk about the election with each\r\nother,” Messner, a political science student,\r\nsays. “There is more awareness than ever\r\nbefore because people are able to converse\r\nopenly and see the different sides of each\r\nissue.”</p> <p>\r\nFor instance, a quick glance at a MySpace\r\npolitics forum reveals discussion threads\r\nranging from “Why is the black vote traditionally\r\nDemocratic?” to “Why Obama continues\r\nto distort McCain’s military record.”\r\nIn these discussions, people from all races,\r\nages, backgrounds and regions converse,\r\nallowing access to points of view that they\r\nmight never have gotten otherwise.</p> <p>\r\nAlthough people of all ages now use these\r\nsocial sites, the majority of users are part\r\nof the “youth vote,” that is between 18 and\r\n29 years old. According to the numbers on\r\nFacebook and Myspace, this group generally\r\ntends to vote more democratic In April\r\n2008, Obama had over 750,000 supporters\r\non Facebook—five times as many as Clinton\r\nand seven times as many as McCain.\r\nThe MySpace numbers, while not as exaggerated,\r\nshowed a similar trend.</p> <p>\r\nHow these numbers will translate in the\r\nelection remains a mystery; after all, the\r\nmillion or so people pledging their support\r\nfor candidates on Facebook represent\r\na mere sliver of the approximately 200 million\r\neligible voters. There’s no doubt, however,\r\nthat candidates will continue to pour\r\nenergy and funds into campaigning with\r\ntechnology.</p> <p>\r\n“In this day and age, I think that the candidates\r\ncan only benefit from taking advantage\r\nof our society’s reliance on the\r\ninternet,” says Hosek. “At this point, it’s\r\nnot even an option for candidates to not be\r\nrepresented online.”</p>', 'Carrie Boecher', 'Carrie Boecher is a junior majoring', 'Wa’el Abdel Samad', 'Matthew Suharli', '2008-09-25', NULL),

Many are familiar with the current\r\nIM software. It seems as though every\r\ncomputer screen has the little box blinking\r\nat the bottom of the screen. New friends frequently\r\nwill ask for an IM address instead\r\nof a phone number. Writing a conversation\r\nto someone is usually less intimidating than\r\nactually speaking on the phone. Entertaining\r\nor functional conversations may last for\r\nhours as new ideas are introduced throughout\r\nthe day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMillions of people worldwide are using IM.\r\nThe age group using this software ranges\r\nfrom under 13 years of age to over 70. According\r\nto the Third Annual Instant Messaging\r\nSurvey, 49 percent of people over\r\nthe age of 55 use IM. Many teens and young\r\nadults are using IM to set up weekend activities,\r\nshare photos, gossip, flirt and complete\r\nhomework with friends. The majority\r\nof IM users who instant message while at\r\nwork believe that it has had a positive impact\r\non their work lives. Employees use IM\r\nto communicate quickly with colleagues, to\r\nget answers and make business decisions,\r\nto check in with friends and family, to interact\r\nwith clients and customers and to exchange\r\nfiles. People say that IM helps them\r\nget more done during the business day, enabling\r\nthem to leave the office earlier.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, the current version of IM has\r\nits drawbacks as it only allows block style\r\nchatting. This means that an entire message\r\nmust be typed and then the “send” button\r\nhas to be hit in order for the other person\r\nto see the message. This can be beneficial\r\nwhen speaking with an unfamiliar person,\r\nbut can also be irritating for those who need\r\ntheir precious time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis issue is addressed by Gregg Vanderheiden,\r\na professor in UW-Madison’s college\r\nof engineering Trace Center, which addresses\r\nthe communication needs of people\r\nwho are nonspeaking and have severe disabilities.\r\n“You’re typing a message, and\r\nthen you sit there,” Vanderheiden says. “It\r\nis really slow…. It breaks up the rhythm.”</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll IM users are familiar with having to\r\ntype a message and then having to sit there,\r\nwaiting, hoping for a reply. What if all of\r\nthis waiting could be eliminated? What if\r\ntwo people in an IM conversation could see\r\nthe partner’s words being typed, letter for\r\nletter? Now that’s instant messaging.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn January 15, 2008, AOL introduced the\r\nfirst version of real-time instant messaging\r\nas an added function. “It’s out; it’s public,\r\nand everyone can use it,” Vanderheiden\r\nsays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis feature was initially designed by researchers\r\nat Gallaudet University and the\r\nTrace Center to serve the deaf and hard\r\nof hearing customers who are using IM as\r\ntheir primary source of communication.\r\nThis new feature has the potential to also\r\noffer a natural-flowing conversational experience\r\nfor all users.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNorman Williams of Gallaudet University\r\ndeveloped the first prototype with a realtime\r\ntext feature so that IM buddies are allowed\r\nto see each letter as it is being typed.\r\nWilliams is deaf himself, which motivated\r\nhim to push for creating a more instant IM\r\nprogram. The conversation will be smoother\r\nand faster, allowing for interruptions or\r\nquestions in a logical order as in a telephone\r\nconversation. Someone who depends on\r\nIM as a primary source of communication\r\nshould be able to receive the same benefits\r\nand intimacy as a telephone conversation,\r\nwhich has logical and ordered interruptions\r\nand comments. In search of a more personal\r\nrelationship through IM, Williams changed\r\nthe box that displays that a buddy is typing\r\nto show the actual letter being typed by the\r\nbuddy. The need and desire for this feature\r\nwas apparent by AOL’s response when introduced\r\nto the new project. “[AOL] committed\r\non the spot,” Vanderheiden says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral convenient possibilities are available\r\nwith this new feature. Those workers\r\nwho said that IM helped them finish work\r\nfaster will be able to speak to colleagues\r\nwith even more speed, potentially allowing\r\nfor more productivity in the office. Researchers\r\nare working on another option to\r\nhave IM set up with an emergency service.\r\nIf someone online starts to type a message\r\nto “911” the conversation should automatically\r\nkick into real-time text so that\r\nthe emergency helper can see as much of a\r\nmessage being typed as possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat about those who are poor at typing\r\nand do not want their buddy to see their\r\nmistakes? Not a problem. By a simple key\r\ncombination, “ctrl-r,” the real-time text\r\nfunction can be turned on or off. This convenience\r\nallows someone to type a long\r\nor important message, make sure they get\r\nit correct and then send it without anyone\r\nseeing the amount of effort put into it.\r\nThen, after a conversation has begun, the\r\nreal-time text function may be easily turned\r\non for a more fluent, intimate and time-effective\r\nexperience.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA writer can also go out of real-time text to\r\ncut a paragraph from another document,\r\npaste it into the message box and then send\r\nit. Or the person can remain in real-time\r\ntext mode and paste. “[Your buddy] will\r\nsee it immediately as it is pasted in. Like a\r\nvery fast typist,” Vanderheiden says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter understanding that the new real-time\r\ntext option can be easily turned on and off,\r\na number of UW-Madison college students\r\nwere asked about their potential usage of\r\nthe added feature. The results gave a 50-\r\n50 split. Half of the students said that they\r\nwould sometimes use this option, while the\r\nother half said that they would never want\r\nto use it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe fact that so many students would not\r\nwant to use the real-time feature demonstrates\r\nthe level of comfort of having a time\r\nbarrier between the writer and receiver.\r\nMost people feel more confident knowing\r\nthat they can spell check and review their\r\nwords. The developers understand this.\r\n“Some people just don’t ever want to use\r\n[real-time text],” Vanderheiden says. He\r\nrelates this new feature to another current\r\noption that has become available with IM.\r\n“It’s like video. Some people like video,\r\nothers don’t.”</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, AIM 6.8 has the new real-time\r\ntext option out as a Beta until a final version\r\nis completed. “This is on its way towards\r\nbeing mainstream,” Vanderheiden says.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n', 'Sally Green', 'Sally is a senior in chemical\r\nand biological engineering who is involved\r\nwith several student organizations.', 'Anika Lohrentz, and Frederik Sua', 'Eric Harris', '2008-09-25', NULL),
('nov082008novprof', 'A Closer Look at Science', 'profprofile', '', 'November', 2008, '<p>The Materials Science Building at UW-Madison has a variety of impressive labs used to test and analyze different materials. Some of these labs are inconspicuous, like one in the basement, which is simply a room filled with nothing but air conditioning units, a single monitor and a series of large cabinets. However, within those cabinets, there is a high-end supercomputer with the power to simulate materials by processing down to each individual atom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Izabela Szlufarska, a professor in the materials science department, is one of the founders of this lab. Originally from Poland, Szlufarska came to The United States nine years ago to seek her PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics in 1999. After graduating from the University of Tennessee, she took a road trip, packing up all her belongings in her car and heading to Los Angeles. With no set plan for the trip, each morning was an adventure as she got out her map, deciding where to go next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In research you are an explorer as well… many times, you go where no one has gone before,” Szlufarska says. It was her drive towards adventure that brought her to the United States and into her area of research. She says research is her way of seeking adventure and always doing new and exciting things with her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her early years, Szlufarska was a math-oriented girl with a passion for learning how things work. In Poland, she was one of few girls who attended a specialized high school with extended programs in math, physics and computer science. “Unfortunately\r\nI did not have a very fun experience in high school because it was so demanding and competitive,” Szlufarska says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november08/images/2008novprof1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Izabela Szlufarska does most of her research in the Materials Science & Engineering Building every day.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Szlufarska, her college years in Poland were similar. She was one of very few women in physics—but that didn’t keep her from getting her MD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Szlufarska is at the cutting-edge of computational material simulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her group employs molecular dynamic simulations, which work at the most fundamental\r\nlevel by processing a material as a large grouping of atoms connected through basic forces. With this kind of simulation it can be determined how to best design a material at the atomic level so that it will yield optimized properties for needed applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One specific area Szlufarska is researching is nano-mechanics. Her work with friction, adhesion and wear at the nanoscale has lead to her Air Force Young Investigator Program award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the nanoscale, surface forces can play a dominant role, meaning they are important\r\nfor any engineering design where two surfaces are in contact. An example of application are micro electromechanical\r\nsystems (MEMS) devices. These tiny engines have potential in various fields, but their performance is limited by the adhesion between them. MEMS are currently\r\nmade of silicon where large adhesion\r\nand friction forces cause these devices\r\nto fail very quickly. This is where a computer simulation can be very useful, because it allows scientists to determine what fundamental physical and chemical processes are involved in sliding. Understanding\r\nand quantifying these processes would allow for predicting the coefficient of friction and performance of materials. Currently, even if all material properties were known, the frictional response could not be predicted. The computer simulations\r\nhave led her to a recent breakthrough\r\nwhere, together with her student Yifei Mo, Szlufarska proposed laws of friction at the nanoscale and showed how they relate to the chemistry of contacting surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november08/images/2008novprof2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">MS&E is planning on adding another supercomputer similar to the one to the right of Professor Szlufarska. The multiple rack mounted processors are combined and used to simulate complex atomic behavior of materials at the nanoscale.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Szlufarska’s results explain controversies that have haunted friction experiments at the nanoscale. However, this is only beginning.\r\n“I think it will still be years before there is a more reliable and unified theory for friction, but we will continue working in this direction,” Szlufarska says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another area of research getting attention and the CAREER award from the National Science Foundation is Szlufarska’s work dealing with biosensors. This project is in collaboration with Robert Hamers from the UW-Madison chemistry department. The idea behind a biosensor is that first a very small structure is taken within a particular measurable resonance. When a target molecule\r\nattaches itself to that structure, the resonance frequency changes. Currently, Szlufarska is working on a theory to detect the structure of the target molecule as it attaches\r\nto the biosensor based on the specific change in resonance. Although similar technology\r\nexists at the macroscale, theories do not hold on smaller scales and this is the first time someone is looking at this problem.\r\nIf successful, this technology would have a broad range of medical and defense applications, such as detecting chemical agents in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Materials science is a very interdisciplinary field with ties to physics, chemistry, biology,\r\nmetallurgy and engineering. One of the main reasons Szlufarska came to work at UW-Madison was because there aren’t stiff boundaries between departments. This has allowed Szlufarska to easily collaborate with professors from outside the materials science department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now in her fourth year of teaching at UW-Madison, Szlufarska says she is finally getting\r\nsome free time again. An active person, she frequently enjoys rollerblading on the bike paths and has recently taken up salsa dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her passion outside of work is working to bridge the gap between science and faith. She spends her free time looking at where conflicts lie and how the two views of the world interact. She participates in a Christian\r\nfaculty fellowship on campus to talk about these issues and invites speakers to discuss the topic further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as where her motivation came from, Szlufarska believes she has her parents to thank. Although neither of them attended college, her father was always interested in science and engineering. He got her reading books at a young age and would show her how things work around the house, such as their car engine. “My parents always believed\r\nin me and told me that the sky is the limit. They told me to have big dreams and that it doesn’t matter what people tell me along the way,” Szlufarska says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she is currently teaching two courses (one undergraduate and one graduate),\r\nSzlufarska loves interacting with students one-on-one more than teaching classes. “My proudest moments being here are when I see my students succeed in what they do at UW-Madison and after they graduate,” she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think that overall Izabela is a very good mentor. She’s very nice and extremely supportive\r\nto her students. She’s very considerate\r\nand always thinking on the side of students.\r\nShe has been encouraging me when I came across problems in my PhD study and other aspects of life. And no matter how busy is she, she’s always been helpful,” Yifei Mo, a graduate student in Szlufarska’s lab, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Szlufarska encourages students to find a mentor\r\nwho can give them advice and encouragement\r\nalong the way. “All of us have had doubts at times on whether or not we have what it takes, but doubts are a normal part of taking a risk and living your life fully.”</p>', 'Cody Wenzel', 'Cody Wenzel is a transfer student from UW-La Crosse.

And they make these patterns at the density and the size of the features that would be applicable\r\nto the hard drive industry,” Nealey says. These block copolymer materials spontaneously\r\nself-assemble into structures that are approximately the correct size, regularity and spacing that are useful for mass data storage\r\nin a hard drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The question is how we get these materials to spontaneously organize into those [nanometer-\r\nsized] assemblies over a macroscopic-length scale,” Nealey says. The standard size of a hard disk in most PC’s is 2.5 inches in diameter. The configuration of the individual\r\nbits of magnetic surface material needs to orient absolutely perfectly in order to function\r\nin a data storage device. This is a significant\r\naspect of the bit-patterned media’s use of block copolymers, as engineers must rely on the self-assembling feature of the material\r\nto function predictably and perfectly at the sub-micron level over a relatively long range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What professor de Pablo and I have been doing is developing methodologies for inducing\r\nthese self-assembling materials to spontaneously order like they want to, only with degrees of perfection and the arrangements\r\nthat are necessary for this intended manufacturing process,” Nealey says. This is not an easy task considering the large number of molecules involved at the resolution\r\nneeded to satisfy advancing industry standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are more spots on a single disc than there are people in the world, and each one has to be standing in their right place,” Nealey\r\nsays. “They have to be absolutely perfect in concentric circles because they spin. You can’t tolerate a missing or misplaced spot in a 15 nanometer domain.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The polymer materials self-assemble in regular\r\npatterns over relatively long ranges compared\r\nto the size of a molecule, on the order of microns, but there are grains in the material, which effectively are defects that are not tolerated\r\nfor this application. Nealey and de Pablo are working to control the crystal structure to form a single crystal following the path of concentric circles. There is an induced strain in the material when bending a straight line, so the researchers are using a method known as directed assembly to induce the stresses necessary\r\nto cause that bending strain. Directed assembly provides input information to the self-assembling material, essentially telling it how to assemble in a way that is more perfect and directed in the orientation that is necessary\r\nfor the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nealey and de Pablo are using advanced lithography\r\ntools from the microelectronics industry in combination with the self-assembling\r\nmaterials to achieve extremely high-resolution data storage density. The lithography\r\ntools are used to make chemical patterns to establish long-range order for the directed assembly process. The block copolymers assemble\r\nthemselves on those chemical patterns and then interpolate the small spaces between the lithography tools that cannot pattern. This combination of processes is capable of achieving\r\nvery precise short-range order with a density\r\nthat surpasses the capabilities of lithography\r\nalone. The combination also achieves the long-range macroscopic alignment that is necessary for device fabrication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One important aspect of this fabrication technique\r\nis called density multiplication. Density\r\nmultiplication implies that manufacturers will only need to pattern the material of every fourth spot on the substrate. The other spots in the array will pattern themselves according to the inherent nature of the self-assembling block copolymers. This has the potential to greatly reduce the time and cost of fabrication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different strategies and approaches being pursued to increase the capacity and the density of data storage devices. If bit-patterned\r\nmedia becomes the method that is adopted\r\nas the new industrial standard, there is a good chance that the block copolymer materials\r\nwill be used. According to Nealy and de Pablo, this will happen very soon as market trends continuously demand more information\r\nto be stored on smaller devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The block copolymer team, comprised of UW-Madison and Hitachi Global Storage Technology\r\nresearch staff, published this work in Science\r\nmagazine in August 2008. In the paper they demonstrate a storage density of one terabit (1012) of information per square inch. The current industry standard is about one third of that. Recent trends show the capacities tend to double every year. This leads Nealey and de Pablo to believe that this technology will reach consumers in about three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As with most advances, these things don’t happen over night. They come about through a fundamental understanding of the materials and the parameters that govern how the materials\r\nbehave,” Nealey says, acknowledging the work that has taken over a decade to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have had this vision for some time that using these materials in this kind of way might have these kinds of applications and that we might be able to meet the constraints of manufacturing like the perfection, the order\r\nand the dimension,” Nealey says. “Now we have shown it to a degree that is being accepted\r\nby industry.”</p>', 'Matthew Stauffer', 'Matt Stauffer is a 5th year senior\r\nin the Materials Science Engineering department.

('nov08economy_crisis', 'Finacial crisis forces reality check', 'editorial', '', 'November', 2008, '<P>\r\nIn the past four and a half years, I have comfortably resided within the collegiate bubble. While the rest of the country grappled with ridiculous gas prices, meager social security checks, and unfathomable health care premiums, I was relatively oblivious. In fact, there were times when my greatest fear was whether or not I would finish my statistics homework before next weekend’s football game. Naturally, when I first caught wind of this so-called “economic crisis,” I assumed that my bubble would protect me.\r\n</P><P>\r\n<B>Wrong. Reality struck me on two fronts:</B>\r\n</P><P>\r\n1. We tend to forget that friends and family members are living outside the college safe-haven. So while we may not be the ones with diminishing 25-year investments into a 401(K), our parents are, and they’re getting a little nervous. Up until this semester,\r\nI had not once considered my parents’ financial situation to be anything but stable, so it was incredibly unsettling to call home and hear my mom talk about losing money from her retirement fund—something we assume to be a relatively safe investment.\r\n</P><P>\r\n2. Since this will be my last semester on campus, I spent a significant portion of my time searching for post-graduation jobs. However, due to the economic instability, the number of companies that are hiring this semester has suddenly decreased. Businesses\r\nare reevaluating their future plans and some have determined that their need for new hires can wait until the economy becomes (or at least appears to be) slightly more stable. While we may have had a record number of employers at the Fall 2008 engineering career fair, an e-mail sent out in mid-October by the UW-Madison ECS office indicates that, in light of the economic downturn, companies’ plans to hire have decreased approximately 7.2% from their August estimates (this data was collected by NACE in a Job Outlook survey of 126 employers). This means that the number of new hires for the class of 2009 will be about the same as last year, when it was initially projected to increase.\r\n</P><P>\r\nAlthough our nation’s current financial uncertainty is a bit unnerving, the fact that we’re dealing with it as college students rather than as middle-aged adults may actually be to our benefit. Unlike our parents, since we aren’t looking to retire within the next 10 to 15 years, we don’t need that sense of security that a retirement fund typically offers. \r\n</P><P>\r\nHowever, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be making smart financial decisions while we’re still young. The U.S. got into this mess because our greed got the best of us, and, contrary to what some might think, we are not indestructible. So unless we start making\r\na conscious effort to limit our spending and live within our means, it is possible that more of us will start to experience the financial plaguing that has begun to spread across the nation. \r\n</P><P>\r\nMany are optimistic, though. With any luck, the next few months will reveal a complete economic turnaround, and we will all be breathing sighs of relief and exclaiming, “See? I told you it wouldn’t last long.” But even if this is the case, by no means should we go back to our old habits of excessive spending. As citizens of the United States, I would hope that we care enough about our nation’s future to find a way to regulate ourselves, regardless of the example that our government has set for us. For me, this means creating a financial plan in preparation for when I graduate in the next month, since it will undoubtedly be tempting\r\nto spend money once I have a larger paycheck.\r\n</P><P>\r\nIt goes without saying that my bubble has thinned significantly over the course of the semester. And although it will officially burst this December when I walk in the commencement ceremony, I have come to terms with my fate. I have accepted the fact that I will be living frugally during the first few years of my life in the “real world,” and fully understand that smart decisions now will result in financial security later. I can only hope that my life lessons will help my peers to realize that our nation’s financial uncertainty affects everyone, and that the more prepared we are now, the easier it will be to adjust to life outside our bubble.\r\n</P>', 'Jaynie Sammons', '', '', 'Richard Bergs', '2008-11-24', NULL);

('nov08on_campus_Nov_0', 'Discovering the Future', 'article', '', 'November', 2008, '<P>\r\nIt’s a beautiful afternoon in October, and I’m sitting in Union South, staring out the window. Across the street, cranes swing about, bulldozers push debris to the sides, and Bobcats climb over the bumpy terrain. These machines, along with approximately 60 workers, are constructing the new Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a multi-disciplinary research complex that is slated to open in late 2010. Funded by the state of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and a generous gift from UW-Madison alumni John and Tashia Morgridge, the Institutes will operate in a unique format that puts public and private researchers side by side. According to George Austin, the building project manager, this configuration will ultimately benefit the Institutes.\r\n</P><P>\r\nWhile the Institutes discoveries in science, engineering and medicine will certainly be innovative, the facility itself will be revolutionary in its construction, design and function. In contrast to many of the older buildings on campus, every aspect of the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery has been taken into account in order to maintain it’s position as a forerunner in multiple areas of research for many years to come.\r\n</P><P>\r\n“One of the fundamental elements going forward is to have a one hundred year building. We want the building to be relevant to the science that will be conducted there for a very long period of time,” Austin says.\r\n</P><P>\r\nCompare this to the building in which I’m currently working, Union South, which will be razed in January 2009. Built in 1971, the union’s cold architecture and poor design no longer accommodate the needs of the campus.\r\n</P><P>\r\nAt the Wisconsin Institutes, however, architects and builders are looking forward. For instance, floor and ceiling heights are designed to allow for potential expansion. Extra space in the ceiling allows for new wires, pipes and other services to be added in over time. The labs themselves will also be extremely flexible. Not only does this allow many types of research teams to use the same labs in the present, but it will also accommodate changes in future research and technology.\r\n</P><P>\r\nIn addition to the building being designed to last, it is also being designed to reduce its impact on the environment. To measure this, builders are comparing its consumption of resources to that of similar buildings on campus. One goal for the facility is to use 50 percent less energy and water than a building like the Biochemistry addition, which, at only ten years old, is a fairly young structure. Since laboratories tend to use more energy and water than typical buildings, designers and builders are looking for unique ways to reduce and reuse these resources.\r\n</P><P>\r\nIn one of the many creative solutions, for instance, the water used for purification in wet laboratories will be captured and sent to toilets and urinals in the building.\r\n</P><P>\r\nThis pledge for environmental responsibility is partially due to the Morgridges who specifically requested that the building be as sustainable as possible—including its construction. At the outset of the project, the goal was to recycle 80 percent of demolition and construction debris. For demolition debris, the actual number was an impressive 98 percent. The majority of these materials were used again as building materials, such as bricks and wall boards, and others, like fixtures, were taken to be reused by non-profit groups.\r\n</P>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src="http://www.wisconsinengineer.com/november08/images/NOV08discovery2web.jpg" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Sustainablity is a top priority in the design and construction of the facility.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\nOverall, the founders of the Institutes for Discovery want the facility to act as a bridge between the research being performed and the community. One of the most important tools in achieving this connection will be the ground floor of the building, called the Town Center. In this space, researchers, professors, students and the general public will be able to mingle around a coffee bar and cafeteria, listen to seminars in the central forum and have personal discussions in one of the many breakout rooms that are scattered throughout the floor. These interactions will hopefully make the Institutes for Discovery two of the top research facilities in the country.\r\n</P>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src="http://www.wisconsinengineer.com/november08/images/NOV08discovery3web.jpg" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery will be located on the entral campus, at the 1300 block of University Avenue between Campus Drive and University Avenue.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n“We encourage people to use the ground floor as a pathway as well as a destination,” Austin says. “[We] want to utilize that space in relation to the science occurring in the building and ultimately to create opportunities under the Wisconsin Idea.”\r\n</P>\r\n\r\n', 'Carrie Boecher and Mike Sargent', '<P>\r\nCarrie Boecher is a junior majoring in civil and environmental engineering.

Ratio is responsible for producing\r\nthe hydrogel-based pump (the core technology of the drug delivery device).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the 2008 UW-Madison Coulter Translational Research Partnerships is a project design a non-electric, pain-free drug delivery device. This partnership pairs David\r\nBeebe, a professor in the biomedical engineering department, with Carol Diamond,\r\na pediatrician at the UW-Madison hospital, with the goal of researching the drug delivery device both from an academic\r\nand medicinal standpoint. Ben Moga, a graduate student in biomedical engineering,\r\nis also participating in the project and is in charge of the laboratory research with guidance from Beebe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History of the design\r\nThe project started five years ago when David\r\nEddington, a former student of Beebe, published a PhD thesis on the swelling of polymer hydrogels to be able to control a drug delivery device. Since then, the team of biomedical engineering professor, pediatrician\r\nand student have worked to design a device that best utilizes this swelling to deliver a liquid pharmaceutical. The first step was creating a crude prototype that has already gone through test trials in animals.\r\nThese trials helped determine the best design geometries and were used to prove that the basic design actually delivered the pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current design “is a pump that is worn like a patch,” Moga says. “When you think of pumps, you think of things like insulin;\r\nput it on, press a button [and receive an] electronic infusion for so many hours. When you think of a patch, you think of a nicotine patch or birth control. We’re going for low profile, except we’re actually doing a bolus injection of liquid pharmaceutical.” This device will allow the wearer to receive a transdermal (across the skin) infusion of liquid medication over a period of time, but its operation will be as simple as sticking it on the body and pressing a button—no electricity required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How the drug delivery system works\r\nThe scientific discovery behind the non-electric device is the polymer hydrogel. When injected with water, this hydrogel reacts\r\nand expands at a certain rate that can be changed by altering the chemistry of the hydrogel. The hydrogel is placed next to a foil-based material storing the drug, known as a drug bladder, and the hydrogel’s expansion\r\npushes the liquid pharmaceutical out of the drug bladder and into the patient. Between\r\nthe hydrogel and the swelling bladder,\r\nwhich stores the water necessary for hydrogel expansion, is a middle insert that serves two functions, according to Moga. “It gives a wall for the hydrogel to push on, and we’ve also designed it so that water basically floods [the hydrogel]; that way, our rate is controlled by the hydrogel itself because it always has access to water.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src="http://www.wisconsinengineer.com/november08/images/nov08geldel.jpg" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The device\\''s simple exterior masks complex interworkings that facilitate drug delivery.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing needed to initiate hydrogel expansion is the push of the button, which simply opens the connection between the hydrogel and the swelling bladder. This button would also activate the drug transport\r\nsystem, an array of microneedles. These microneedles are plastic and only 300 micrometers long. Because they’re so tiny, they don’t cause pain when they puncture the skin. However, they also cannot withstand\r\nthe same pressures that hypodermic needles, the type normally associated with drug delivery shots like vaccinations, are able to. Further research needs to be done to characterize the microneedles and determine\r\nwhether their properties are sufficient to penetrate the skin and deliver the drug. “There has been a lot of work done on microneedles\r\nalready, [which have] guided the designs I’ve made of the microneedles,” Moga says. “It’s not something we’re horribly\r\nworried about but it’s something I’m entirely mindful of moving forward.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of the drug delivery system\r\nOver the next nine months the team will continue to conduct research in the engineering\r\nlaboratory and through animal trials, mostly focused on the unique challenges\r\npresented by the microneedles. Once the drug delivery design has been proven effective, it will be submitted to the FDA for approval. Depending on how the FDA classifies it, the product could be approved as soon as two years from now. However, it is more likely that clinical trials will take longer than a year and the design would be FDA-approved in four to six years. Following\r\napproval, the device will need to be prepared for mass production. Although this may take a little time, it will make the device cheaper and ultimately smaller due to automated manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final device will be able to deliver liquid\r\npharmaceuticals of sizes ranging from 250 microliters to five milliliters over a time period of a few minutes to eight hours, depending\r\non the size of the delivery dose and the length of sustained injection time needed. Although the drug delivery system\r\nwas initially designed for injections of drugs combating hemophilia, they could also deliver other liquid drugs like certain pain medications and vaccines. Imagine the global increase in disease containment if vaccines were available in cheap, single-use patches!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../november08/images/Nov08Coulter1WEB.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The device\\''s diminutive size incorporates a painless drug delivery system, which is capable of delivering medication typically only deliverable via hypodermic needles.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the drug delivery device may be able to do multi-drug injections or even deliver narcotics safely. “Because there is a problem with addicts breaking in devices and getting the drug…we can either get more controlled dosing strictly out of prescription\r\nwhen they’re distributing it, or we can somehow engineer it so that it knows it’s on the skin; that’s the only way it’ll work, or it’s impossible to get the drug out without destroying itself,” Moga says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Moga, Beebe and Diamond finish their research on the non-electric drug delivery\r\nsystem, they will have changed the medical industry for the better. Not only will their system be cheap and painless, but it will also be easy for both medical professionals\r\nand patients to use, thus reducing the hassle of modern needle injections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until then, be sure to enjoy your well-deserved\r\nlollipop from the doctor’s office.</p>\r\n', 'Emilie Siverling', 'Emilie Siverling is a senior majoring in materials science and engineering.

This year, SEMATECH graciously\r\ndonated a Zygo phase-shifting interferometer\r\nto UW-Madison’s Computational\r\nMechanics Center.</p><p>\r\nThe phase-shifting interferometer is a device commonly used to measure optical components. With the goal of making computer chips smaller and faster, the Computational Mechanics Center has made a home for the instrument and begun research.</p><p>\r\nSEMATECH’s senior staff member Chris Van Peski chose to move the interferometer from Austin, Texas to UW-Madison to better serve the industry as a whole. Van Peski was previously using the device for the same type of research, but in light of his recent retirement passed the torch to Roxann Engelstad’s lab.</p><p>\r\nJacob Zeuske, a UW-Madison mechanical engineering graduate student, plays a large role in the experimentation with the interferometer. He is one of two people with access to the high-tech machine—the other being Engelstad, the head of the department. Zeuske is using the interferometer to explore extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology so that the process can be perfected to produce computer chips that are a fraction of the size, 100 times faster and can hold 1000 times as much memory.</p><p>\r\nThe VeriFire MST interferometer, is the model of the device donated by SEMATECH and is manufactured by Zygo. It uses a wavelength shifting laser and data acquisition techniques to enable simultaneous measurements of both the front and back surface of transparent optics. “Basically what we are doing is measuring gaps between two surfaces,” Zeuske says. Currently, the lab is taking measurements of the flatness of the circular glass plates (known as substrates) for SEMATECH, and the data from these measurements is used as the input to models which simulate EUVL processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"http://www.wisconsinengineer.com/november08/images/Sematech-Originals%20011web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">A close-up shot of the instrument set up to measure the flatness of the square substrate, the oblique piece of glass at the lower right.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, lithography is a method of transferring a pattern from one surface to another. The Computational Mechanics Center is concerned with the mechanical aspects of EUVL; the lab is using the interferometer to measure the glass plates and predict any deformation in the glass substrates that may happen while being patterned.</p><p>\r\nIn the future, when the technology is in use, a circuit pattern will be deposited into a layer of the glass plate and then reflected onto the silicon wafer. While the pattern is being put into the glass, it is possible that some bowing may occur,. This means that in addition to any pre-existing non-flatness, there will be some irregularities in the substrate. “It’s really important that the glass is flat when you do this; if it’s not flat, the pattern you put on it will be distorted,” Zeuske says. When working on nanometer scale, accuracy is very important so it is imperative to know what is going to be reflected. The glass can be flattened by using an electrostatic chuck to create an electrostatic force that pulls the glass into a flatter shape. “You can never achieve perfect flatness, but if we know what we have, we can correct for it,” Zeuske says. The lab is experimenting to see if the non-flatness measured by the interferometry system can be corrected by altering the initial pattern in the substrate.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPrior to the donation of the interferometer, UW-Madison collaborated with SEMATECH on various other projects. In 1997, SEMATECH funded a $2 million research project lead by Engelstad at UW-Madison. At that time, the semiconductor manufacturing process needed to be revamped and the mechanical engineering department simulated four new approaches for the consortium of semi-conductor manufacturers. The EUVL, which is what UW-Madison’s new interferometer uses, was one of the methods modeled in 1997.</p><p>\r\nWith this donation, the Computational Mechanics Center is on the forefront of leading technology in this field. Currently there is a limit on how small computer chips can be made. However, “It is hoped that it [EUVL] will allow the patterning of much smaller features. It holds the potential for achieving nanometer scale features,” says Zeuske, which could lead to many new possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"center\\">\r\n<img src=\\"http://www.wisconsinengineer.com/november08/images/Sematech-Originals%20002web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The phase shifting laser, on the left, emits the illuminating laser beam at various wavelengths, acting as the light source for the instrument.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n', 'Roxanne Wienkes', 'Roxanne is a junior studying environmental engineering.

The posters shout the names of products they are displaying—“\r\nKudamushi,” “Handicotti,” “Healthy sTart”—and are covered in graphs, flow charts and colorful photographs of the products. </p><p>\r\nThese posters present the final projects from past years of the UW-Madison Food Product Development Team, a campus organization that competes nationally by inventing and producing new and innovative food products.\r\nFor instance, the “Healthy sTart” consists of a bowl made from granola and filled with yogurt and fruit—a perfect on-the-go snack that’s nutritious. The UW-Madison team won top honors with this product at the 2005 competition\r\nhosted by the Institute of Food Technology\r\nStudent Association, one of the biggest product development contests of the year.</p><p>\r\nProduct development is only one component of the Food Science Club at UW-Madison. The group of about 45 undergraduate students\r\nworks to increase their knowledge in the area of food science, apply what they learn in classes to the real world, learn about future job prospects and just have some fun.</p><p>\r\n“The Food Science Club is a great way for all of us in the major to connect and get to know each other,” Banaszynski, the current president\r\nof the club, says. “It also allows us to utilize\r\nour skills from classes to come together in competition.”</p><p>\r\nIn addition to product development, Food Science\r\nClub members compete in dairy judging, where students assess various dairy products for inconsistencies, and college bowl, a sort of quiz bowl. College bowl questions cover a variety of topics within food science, and can range from, “Which bacteria help in Swiss cheese production?” to “What is the spongy white tissue in an orange called?”</p><p>\r\nThe competition that relies most on design and engineering is the Product Development Team. Each year, there are numerous product development competitions hosted around the country by a variety of organizations. Some of the competitions in which the UW-Madison\r\nteam has participated in the past include those held by the Almond Board of California, NASA and the aforementioned Institute of Food Technology Student Association. These competitions usually take place in late spring and early summer, but the team starts preparing\r\nas early as September. The first step, of course, is coming up with the right product. So how exactly does the team settle on an idea?</p><p>\r\n“We start by brainstorming,” Renaud, the current\r\nchair of the Product Development Team, says. “We think: what do we want to make, and what markets do we want to fill?”\r\n“A lot of times we’ll look at the new trends on the market. For example, passion fruit is a really big flavor right now, so we might try to incorporate that into the product,” Banaszynski\r\nsays.</p><p>\r\nAnother factor that influences the team’s product is the contest guidelines. The contest sponsored by the Almond Board of California,\r\nfor instance, requires that the products feature—not surprisingly—an almond base. Other competitions might have rules for the number of calories or the amount of a certain nutrient in the product.</p><p>\r\nAfter the team settles on an idea for a particular competition, the experimentation begins. For months, the team meets in the food lab, preparing batch after batch of the proposed product. Using their food science knowledge, members tweak the recipes a little bit at a time until they are just right.</p><p>\r\n“[The process] requires a lot of trial and error,”\r\nBanaszynski says. “It’s like when you’re younger and you bake cookies; if they’re too wet, you try adding more flour.”</p><p>\r\n“All ingredients have functionality,” Renaud says. “As food scientists, it’s our job to know exactly what each of those ingredients does.”</p><p>\r\nBesides preparing the perfect product, the team has to come up with a comprehensive plan for its production. They must include the nutritional\r\ncontent of the food, a model for efficient and safe production of the item on a large scale and processing steps for the product. They also conduct sensory tests, in which test subjects try the product and rate it in areas such as flavor and texture. All of this information must be compiled into a written report and submitted months before the actual competition, usually in February. It’s a lot of work, but when it comes to the competition, it pays to be thorough.</p><p>\r\n“We get judged on how well we think of the product,” Renaud says. “We can’t just say, ‘Let’s make something.’ We have to think about how we’re going to make it, how we’re going to market it and what consumer group we’re targeting.”\r\nAccording to Renaud and Banaszynski, teams are also judged on the innovation of their products,\r\nas well as the ability of the products to fill voids in the market. For instance, some products are marketed as ready-to-eat in order to meet the growing demands of a busy population,\r\nwhile others are designed to be heart-healthy to appeal to older customers.</p><p>\r\nSo exactly what kinds of new foods have been invented over the years? The last big winner for the team was “Kudamushi” in 2006. “Kudamushi”\r\nis marketed as a “dessert sushi,” though it really isn’t sushi at all. It consists of jasmine rice wrapped in a piece of fruit leather and garnished with a bit of jelly in the center. It can be frozen and thawed as necessary, giving it a long shelf life. Another product is “Handicotti,”\r\na handheld pasta filled with marinara and ricotta cheese. This product was designed as a quick, on-the-go meal. In addition to preparing\r\nthe food itself, the team had to design the perfect pouch in which to hold the pasta.\r\n</p><p>After all the brainstorming, planning and preparation, the team finally gets to the actual competition. There, they compete against other college teams, the majority of whom are from the Midwest. Judges are mostly looking for the innovation of the products, as well as the effort and planning that went into its development, but it doesn’t hurt if it has a good flavor. After all, like Renaud says, “Nobody’s going to want to eat it if it doesn’t taste good.”', 'Carrie Boecher', 'Carrie Boecher is a junior majoring\r\nin civil and environmental engineering.

('nov08digital', 'Going Digital', 'article', '', 'November', 2008, '<p>Has your favorite television show ever disappeared in a snow storm right in the middle of a good part? Have you ever found yourself sitting in awkward\r\npositions in your living room because you didn’t want to interfere with the television\r\nsignal? Well, those days will soon be over. The switch from analog to digital television\r\n(DTV) is fast approaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DTV began in the 1990s when broadcasters\r\nand television manufacturers looked for ways to offer high definition television. The Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) formed and decided digital transmission\r\nwas the answer. Broadcasters asked for a second channel for their digital transmission\r\nin addition to their analog channel. On February 17, 2009 all analog channels will be turned off and returned to the Federal Communications\r\nCommission to be used for other services. Some of the reclaimed spectrum will be auctioned off to generate revenue for the US Treasury. Other parts of the reclaimed spectrum will be used for public services including\r\npolice, fire and ambulance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some students feel the government is scamming\r\nAmericans with the switch—like Lianne Streng, a senior in chemical engineering, who wonders what is wrong with analog and why we are being forced to buy converter boxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is space. In the 1990s, Congress considered the benefits of transitioning from analog to digital and acknowledged the crowding on the broadcast spectrum. To understand what that means, picture a radio that has a hundred stations between 95.1 and 95.3. On a radio like this, it would be difficult to tune in to the station of your choice, and if you wanted to start a radio station at 95.2, it would be very hard to find a space to broadcast\r\nwithout all the other stations drowning you out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The switch to DTV will free up valuable space on the broadcast spectrum. With analog television,\r\nyou receive an analog composite video signal and a separate sound signal. A digital channel carries a 19.39-megabit-per-second (Mbps) stream of digital data that your digital TV receives and decodes. A broadcaster can send a single program at 19.39 Mbps, or they could divide the channel into several different\r\nstreams, called subchannels. For example, they could send four subchannels of 4.85 Mbps each. On top of that, each subchannel can potentially carry a different program. This means stations will be able to multicast—that is, broadcast multiple channels of free programming\r\nall at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Devereaux-Weber, a network consultant\r\nat the DoIT center who specializes in television, says, “as a result [of multi-casting], in the space occupied by one analog channel in standard definition, you can send eleven digital channels in standard definition.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean for UW-Madison students?\r\nIf you are a student living in the dorms, UW-Madison already has been transmitting high definition signals over the residential television network since September 2008. Because all dorms provide cable, students in residence halls do not need to purchase a converter\r\nbox. Students living in houses or apartments\r\nwill not be affected if they are currently subscribing to cable or satellite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you are a student with basic television,\r\nyou will need to buy a converter box in order to continue watching your favorite programs.\r\nTo help with the transition, a federal subsidy program will provide two coupons by mail, each worth $40 off the cost of a converter box, to households that request them. Converter\r\nboxes vary in cost, from $40 to $60. Since various types of converter boxes are available, you have the option of shopping around.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“The February 2009 deadline is when analog over-the-air transmitters are going to be turned off, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you won’t be able to use your analog television anymore. If you are connected to cable TV or satellite, those entities are not required to stop transmitting in analog form, so cable subscribers\r\nand satellite subscribers won’t notice a lot of change,” Devereaux-Weber says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will DTV influence our entertainment,\r\nbut it will also improve our means of observing the world around us. In 2005, Devereaux-Weber participated in the exploration\r\nof hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor called black smokers. The technology that was used on this study was an underwater vehicle named Jason (you may have seen some video from this aquatic robot during the movie Titanic).\r\nRather than having to extract ocean creatures and observe them later, the scientists were able to observe the creatures in their natural\r\nhabitat thanks to the bandwidth provided by the digital broadcasting spectrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving into the digital world doesn’t just mean getting a crystal-clear view of Dr. Phil’s mustache. The transition to DTV is a stepping stone to a new way of broadcasting and viewing\r\ninformation.</p>', 'Bonnie Atkinson', 'Bonnie is a second-year journalism major.

The team’s\r\ntask is to research and develop an airless,\r\nnon-pneumatic tire that is suitable for use\r\non heavy-grade military vehicles, such as\r\nthe Humvee. The idea is that this tire will\r\nbe able to continue to run reliably even after\r\nsustaining heavy damage from enemy fire\r\nor roadside bombs. “The current Humvee\r\nuses a run-flat insert which is supposed to\r\ngo 30 miles per hour for 30 miles,” Edward\r\nHall, vice president of Resilient Technologies,\r\nsays. “And you’re also not going to\r\nbe within 30 miles of some place safe to\r\nchange your tire. So we’re looking at any\r\ntype of continuous mobility to get them\r\nout of harm’s way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resilient Technologies began their work\r\nwith PEC through the engineering professional\r\ndevelopment (EPD) department\r\nat UW-Madison. “They needed to have\r\nsomebody that understood materials, who\r\nunderstood design … they wanted to sort\r\nof work in partnership with the university,\r\nso they got in contact with EPD,” Tim Osswald,\r\nprofessor and lead researcher of\r\nPEC, says. Osswald had already conducted\r\nsome training at Resilient and taught\r\ncourses there on polymers and rubber materials.\r\nThus, he was acquainted with the\r\nfaults of pneumatic tires and the prospects\r\nof polymers in tire design. The problem\r\nwith pneumatic tires is their susceptibility\r\nto puncture and the rapid decline in\r\nstability with a decrease in air pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april09/img/IMG_0644.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"The design of the non-pneumatic tire enables military vehicles to easily maneuver\r\nthrough rough terrain.

Osswald\r\nand Resilient sought to conceive an alternative\r\nmeans of maintaining the functional\r\nstructure of a pneumatic tire without the\r\nweaknesses evident in military applications.\r\nThe team also needed a way of augmenting\r\nthe tire so that the desirable properties\r\nof the pneumatic counterpart were\r\nmaintained, such as consistency in ride\r\nperformance across varying terrain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these criteria in mind, PEC and Resilient\r\nset off and researched exhaustively\r\nfor two years, putting their various designs\r\nthrough a battery of tests and analyses.\r\nTheir efforts yielded a novel rubber polymer-\r\nbased structure reinforced by an array\r\nof hexagonal shapes, more commonly referred\r\nto as “honeycomb” structures. “We\r\nhad a couple of brainstorming sessions\r\ntogether with Resilient where we kind of\r\njointly came up with the idea of using these\r\nhoneycomb structures,” Osswald says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april09/img/Final-2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Professor Tim Osswald, lead researcher\r\nof the Polymer Engineering Center,\r\ndisplays his prototype of the airless\r\ntire.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Tim Osswald, lead researcher\r\nof the Polymer Engineering Center,\r\ndisplays his prototype of the airless\r\ntire. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In testing the honeycomb against other\r\nshapes, such as a mesh of diamonds, the\r\nhoneycomb ranked superlatively to the\r\nother designs. To test the designs, researchers\r\napplied damage to the tire and examined\r\nits quality before, during and after\r\nthe damage. Most of the damage done to\r\nthe tires, however, was minimal. “When it\r\ncomes to ballistics testing we run minimal\r\nballistics … with 5 mm rounds” Hall says.\r\n“When it comes to blowing stuff up, we’re\r\ngoing to let the military take care of that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to their aesthetic appearance,\r\nthese honeycomb wheels are already providing\r\ntangible - and potentially lifesaving,\r\nbenefits; in fact, a number of Humvees\r\nin Iraq are currently fitted with a trial run\r\nof the tire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting aspect of the wheel\r\nis its potential in the consumer market.\r\n“From an engineering standpoint there are\r\nall kinds of vehicles like tractors and heavy\r\nequipment that would really benefit from\r\nthese types of tires because they are not\r\npneumatic,” Osswald says. Unlike pneumatic\r\ntires, the polymer material composition\r\nand shape of the honeycomb inside the\r\nairless tire may vary to ensure consistent\r\nperformance for various applications. “We\r\nhave different polymers for different applications.\r\nWith a pneumatic tire you change\r\nthe air pressure depending on what you\r\nwant to do. …What we use is different material,”\r\nHall says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The innovations associated with the latest\r\nrevision of the wheel may help diminish\r\nthe negative connotations associated with\r\n“reinventing the wheel” by reducing the\r\nnumber of lives lost in current and future\r\nmilitary engagements.</p>', 'Melody Pierson and Anthony Lai', 'Anthony is a senior majoring\r\nin computer engineering and political science.\r\nThis is his first semester with the\r\nmagazine.

I, on the other hand,\r\nwas admittedly disappointed when I heard that\r\nchemical engineers don’t have to take EPD 397.\r\nThus, each semester, I’ve been looking through\r\ncourses in the English department, trying to\r\nfind a communications course I could fit into my\r\nbusy schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, you may be thinking I have lost my\r\nmind. Why would an engineering major go out of\r\nher way to write?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, at a young age, I realized that the best way\r\nfor me to get my thoughts across was through\r\nwriting. English being my second language, I\r\nstruggled for a long time with mispronouncing\r\nwords and getting laughed at for it by my classmates.\r\nDetermined to learn the language, I would\r\npick up a dictionary in my spare time and go\r\nthrough it page-by-page, writing out words, trying\r\nto memorize what they meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ll be honest, I didn’t even get to the “c” section.\r\nThere are over 1,500 words that start with the letters\r\n“a” and “b” and, at the time of my obsession\r\nto learn English, I was easily distracted by playing\r\nin the jungle gym.

('feb09february09itf', 'Into The Future', 'article', '', 'February', 2009, '<p>It was shortly after the Manhattan Project in the early 1950s that nuclear technology was first used for power production. The first light water nuclear reactors to produce electricity were derived from the design the U.S. Navy used to build a nuclear-powered fleet. Second generation nuclear reactor models were built in the 1960s, designed specifically for the production of electricity; these models are operating in the U.S. today. Third and fourth generation models have been designed and tested and will likely be used in the development of future plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, nuclear technology is used for three purposes: power production, medical imaging and defense. Uranium, the primary nuclear fuel source, is the heaviest naturally occurring element on Earth. It naturally decays\r\nfrom its pure state to lighter elements because\r\nit is radioactive. As it decays, it trends toward\r\nthe element lead and gets there through a series of reactions. During these reactions, it sheds protons and gives off energy, which can be captured as heat for electricity generation. Uranium forms a number of complex minerals\r\nin nature depending on its surroundings, specifically the element’s proximity to the atmosphere\r\nand to water.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/Feb09nuclearCMYK7.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Uranium fuel cells are cooled by ultra pure water in the UW research reactor.

The characteristic glow is caused by Cherenkov radiation, which occurs when charged particles move faster than the speed of light in a medium.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in the early 1980s that the world consumption\r\nof uranium exceeded the global production. Very little uranium is mined in the U.S. while Canada and Australia are the world leaders of its production. “As usual, the U.S. production piece of the pie is tiny compared to its consumption,” Philip Brown, UW-Madison professor of geology and geophysics, says. “We have been behind\r\nfor the past 30 years… so there needs to be some explanation to how we run this business with the gaping deficit, and it is a wonderfully ironic answer,” Brown says. The “answer” that Brown is referring to is the decommissioning and recycling of nuclear weapons that have extremely rich uranium compensates. By mixing the weapon-grade uranium with newly mined low-grade uranium ore, researchers have discovered that it is possible to make vast amounts of fuel-grade uranium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how long will this fuel supply last? In terms of oil consumption, one study predicts\r\nthat the average energy consumption will asymptote at an energy equivalent of 15 barrels of oil per person per year while the world population is predicted to level out at 10 billion people in the mid-21st century.\r\nIn this century alone, however, the study estimates that humans will consume an energy equivalent of thirteen 13 barrels of oil, a quantity far greater than even the most generous estimation of six trillion barrels\r\nof the world’s reserve of fossil fuels. Clearly, we cannot continue to rely on this energy source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But rhetoric about conventional nuclear power being the energy crisis’s “silver bullet” to eternally meet world energy demands is misleading. “We are nowhere near\r\nforever…Uranium in normal [light water] reactors\r\nhas the potential to get us out through\r\nthe next few decades, but it is not a limitless\r\nsupply,” Brown says. Technologies currently\r\nexist, however, that allow for secondary use\r\nof spent fuel. A reactor technology known\r\nas fast reactors, or breeder reactors, takes the\r\nspent nuclear fuel from light water reactors,\r\nenriches it and allows it to further decay and\r\ncapture more energy from the fuel source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If we don’t use uranium in the proper way,\r\nfission reactors don’t have much of a future—\r\nonly 40 years, 50 years at the most,” Gerald\r\nKulcinski, UW-Madison professor of engineering\r\nphysics and director of the Fusion\r\nTechnology Institute, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One concern of nuclear reactors, common\r\nto all energy production methods, is waste.\r\nHowever, engineering physics professor Michael\r\nCorradini points out that comparing the\r\nwaste from coal and natural gas to the waste\r\nfrom nuclear reactors is comparing apples\r\nto oranges; the waste from nuclear reactors,\r\nthough highly radioactive, is very compact\r\nand locally contained, while the waste from\r\ncoal and gas is highly dispersed and released\r\ndirectly into the atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also the concern that nuclear power\r\nemits harmful radiation. Natural background\r\nradiation is around two-tenths of a rem (the\r\nunit of radiation). Two thousand times natural\r\nbackground is deadly, while 25 times natural\r\nbackground is allowed for workers in fields\r\nthat use radiation. The EPA legislates that\r\nthree times natural background is acceptable\r\nto expose to the general public, a number that\r\nis equivalent to about four x-rays in one year.\r\n“A nuclear power plant releases one percent\r\nnatural background [radiation] to the public\r\neach year,” Corradini says. This is very small,\r\narguably insignificant, compared to radiation\r\nexposure from flying and medical imaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW-Madison has been making its own strides\r\nto research solutions in nuclear power. The\r\nUW-Madison Energy Hub Conference, held\r\nin Madison in November 2008, was host to\r\nenergy policy makers, leading researchers,\r\nindustry professionals and concerned students\r\nand citizens. Patrick Moore opened the\r\nconference with an address that called nuclear\r\nenergy the most cost-effective way of reducing\r\ncarbon emissions and consumption of fossil\r\nfuels. Moore, one of the founding members of\r\nGreenpeace, is the co-chair of the Clean Energy\r\nCoalition, a group in favor of pursuing nuclear\r\nenergy. As an advocate for nuclear energy,\r\nMoore points to the outstanding safety record\r\nof nuclear plants, along with the technology’s\r\nlongevity and potential to improve air quality\r\nby displacing coal and other fossil fuel power\r\nplants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UW-Madison nuclear engineering department\r\nis also conducting research on energy solutions.\r\nWhile the current technology is effective,\r\nimprovements in engineering design and\r\nadvancements of future technology can continually\r\nbe pursued. Fission reactors, for example,\r\ncould use higher efficiency, reduced waste\r\nstreams, operational safety and prolonged\r\nsafety and storage of spent fuel. In fact, there\r\nis theoretical technology being developed at\r\nUW-Madison that aims to produce nuclear energy\r\nwith zero radioactive byproducts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What I am talking about is not something that\r\nis going to happen tomorrow…it is something\r\nthat is farther out. But it is important to plan for\r\nthe long range because, if we focus on the short\r\nrange, we get ourselves into trouble,” Kulcinski\r\nsays. “We have to link near-term, mid-term\r\nand long-term goals all together.”</p>', 'Matt Stauffer', 'Matt Staurffer is a fifth year senior in materials science.

The HGVC is led by Harold Tobin,\r\na UW-Madison associate professor of geophysics.\r\nThe main attraction of the lab is a\r\ntwelve foot screen operating on four LCD\r\nprojectors. The screen is essentially a giant\r\ncomputer monitor with three-dimensional\r\nstereo capabilities. Once you put on the polarizing\r\nglasses, you can practically reach\r\nout and touch the images.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/Geology 033web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">An expert in seismic imagining, Professor Tobin has recently returned from the coast of Japan where he was collecting data for his work on tsunamis.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 30 gigabyte data files containing the\r\nseismic images do not make it to the computer\r\nscreen effortlessly. Collecting data for\r\nunderground images is a time-consuming\r\nprocess. The most common method is to\r\nsend seismic waves into the ground which\r\nthen bounce off of rocks in the subsurface. Highly sensitive microphones are positioned to pick up the reflected sound waves and the data collected is used to create a two-dimensional\r\nprofile of the depths of the rock and sediment formations. “It’s like an ultrasound to image below the surface of the earth,” Tobin says. The two-dimensional profiles are then processed and combined to create an image\r\nwith depth, height and width.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/Geology 011web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">With data of Devil’s Lake State Park the system can vividly project 3D stereographic images of topographic maps and contour lines.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Although seismic imaging was originally created for finding fossil fuels, the technology is now being used for a variety of other purposes. The development of this technology has allowed exploration geophysicists to take research to new depths—literally. “We can image to the core of the earth,” Tobin says. Depending on the purpose of the research, the image acquisition and resolution can be adjusted for the appropriate depth into the earth’s surface. For instance, Tobin’s work focuses on plate tectonics. For his research on the cause of tsunamis, he can obtain high resolution images 10 miles below the ocean floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/Geology 018web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">No Caption</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The HGVC lab is not only for underground seismic imaging. “It is a combination of a research tool and teaching tool,” Tobin says. Students in introductory geology courses can go into the lab, put on the polarizing glasses and view contour maps in an interactive manner. “Our job is to help students learn what is going on in the earth ,” Tobin says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting students familiar with the technology that geologists use can help students explore future careers. Most oil companies, which employ a high volume of geologists, have labs similar to the HGVC. The lab is a major step in integrating the professional world into education and exposing students to what a career in geology has to offer. “The hope is it will get students excited about geology and show them that it is more than just banging on rocks,” Tobin says.</p>', 'Roxanne Wienkes', 'Roxanne is a junior studying environmental engineering.

Professor Pascale Carayon’s\r\nfascination, however, is with people.\r\nAs an industrial and systems engineering\r\n(ISyE) professor with a focus in human\r\nfactors and ergonomics, she studies\r\nhow people work. She then combines her\r\nfindings with her knowledge of technologies\r\nto design systems that improve the\r\nworking environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a high school student in France, Carayon\r\nexcelled in math and physics. Based on the\r\nrecommendation of a high school teacher,\r\nshe applied and was accepted to one of the\r\ntop engineering schools in France. For her\r\nspecialization, she chose engineering economy,\r\nwhich is similar to ISyE in the United\r\nStates. Carayon then traveled to UW-Madison\r\nand earned her PhD. When offered a\r\nposition teaching at the university, she accepted,\r\nciting UW-Madison’s ISyE department’s\r\nquality and breadth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The nice thing about this department is\r\nthat it’s not narrowly focused,” Carayon\r\nsays. “It includes all kinds of disciplines of\r\nindustrial engineering, [including] the human\r\nfactors and ergonomics piece.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carayon has since then climbed the academia\r\nladder and is now the director of\r\nthe Center for Quality and Productivity\r\nImprovement. In 2001, the department received\r\na grant from the Agency for Healthcare\r\nResearch and Quality to study patient\r\nsafety and medical errors. This allowed\r\nCarayon to expand her research into a hospital\r\nenvironment, which, she says, is more\r\nchallenging than researching a typical work\r\nenvironment. Most of her current research\r\nis done in intensive care units (ICUs), which\r\nis a very complex environment since most\r\npatients in intensive care have such unstable\r\nhealth that a small error could be deadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/Jan09professorprofile4WEB.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Professor Carayon and her graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, but\r\nthey all work together to improve the well-being of patients and medical professionals.\r\nFrom left: Teresa Thuemling, Prof. Pascale Carayon, Randi Carthmill, Kerry McGuire,\r\nHelene Faye, Bonnie Paris, Pat Ferrara and Nana Khunlertkit.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Carayon and her graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, but\r\nthey all work together to improve the well-being of patients and medical professionals.\r\nFrom left: Teresa Thuemling, Prof. Pascale Carayon, Randi Carthmill, Kerry McGuire,\r\nHelene Faye, Bonnie Paris, Pat Ferrara and Nana Khunlertkit.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“Trying to implement any change [or] new\r\ntechnology can have tremendous positive\r\nimpacts, but it could have huge, disastrous\r\nconsequences,” Carayon says of the challenges\r\nof researching in ICUs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these difficulties, Carayon feels\r\nup to the challenge. She still does much of\r\nher own primary research, observing and\r\ninterviewing nurses, physicians, pharmacists\r\nand other healthcare professionals\r\nwho have an impact on the way the ICU\r\nis organized and run. From this data collection,\r\nshe can work on solving problems\r\nwith solutions as simple as reorganizing a\r\nsupply closet or as complex as implementing\r\nan entirely different system with new,\r\nunfamiliar technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any new instrument or software that is\r\nput into the ICU needs to be studied to\r\nmake sure it helps job performance and\r\ncommunication. By improving the usability\r\nof technology, flow of information, design\r\nof systems and other processes that\r\nsupport the performance of healthcare\r\nprofessionals, Carayon is confident that\r\nmany medical errors can be eliminated.\r\nThis helps the professionals, who are\r\nmore efficient and happy with their jobs,\r\nand the patients, who receive better care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like her research, many of the classes\r\nCarayon teaches deal with the “people\r\nside” of engineering—human factors\r\nand ergonomics. Over the years, she has\r\nfound that the best way to teach is in a\r\nvery participatory fashion, as opposed to\r\njust lecturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have a lot of knowledge and expertise\r\nthat I like to share with the students,”\r\nCarayon says in reference to her teaching\r\nstyle. “But if I don’t interact with the students…\r\nit’s very difficult for me to be an\r\neffective teacher.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To engage her students, Carayon assigns\r\nreadings, projects and small group exercises. She also brings back many examples\r\nfrom her research to the classroom to make\r\nthe subjects she teaches more real and interesting\r\nfor the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“These are really very interesting topics\r\nto me,” Carayon says. “So if I can share\r\nsome of my enthusiasm with students,\r\nthen I’ve done my job, and I’m happy\r\nwith that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carayon’s passion for people is also\r\nevident in her activities outside of the\r\nuniversity. Since her family still lives\r\nin France, she calls them at least once a\r\nweek, in addition to e-mails. One way she\r\nkeeps up with her nieces is to read what\r\nthey are reading, so she often reads in\r\nboth English and French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carayon’s other activities include preparing\r\nfor a mini-triathlon and art\r\nmetallurgy. She enjoys these activities\r\nbecause they balance out her research\r\nand teaching, but that doesn’t mean that\r\nthey are easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I like swimming, and I like biking,”\r\nCarayon says of her preparation for\r\nthe mini-triathlon. “But of all the other\r\nsports that I have done, running was\r\nalways…a nightmare for me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carayon also enjoys traveling, a lot of\r\nwhich she has been able to do by volunteering\r\nfor international activities like the International\r\nErgonomics Association. Last\r\nyear, she gave a work-related talk in Brazil,\r\nwhich allowed her to enjoy a small vacation\r\nexploring the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While talking to Carayon, her enthusiasm\r\ntowards understanding people and helping\r\nthem is evident. Even in the short time\r\nwe met, Carayon cared enough to inquire\r\nabout my life. I entered the interview expecting\r\na discussion of her life, education\r\nand work; I left having also chatted about\r\nmy interests and goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, learning about people is what she\r\ndoes best.</p>', 'Emilie Siverling', 'Emilie Siverling is a senior\r\nmajoring in materials science and engineering.\r\nThis is her fifth semester with the\r\nmagazine and first in writing.', 'Evan Owens', 'Eric Hitt', '2009-02-14', NULL),

Ever find\r\ngaps between your notes—either because\r\nyou got distracted by the text messages your\r\nfriend was sending you or because you fell\r\nasleep in the middle of lecture?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of what note-taking predicament\r\nyou may have faced in your college career,\r\nthere may be a solution in your near future:\r\nthe Livescribe Pulse Smartpen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Smartpen enables you to digitally transfer\r\nhandwritten notes and sync them to an\r\naudio recording. So, as you are taking notes,\r\nthe Smartpen records what your professor is\r\nsaying, therefore ensuring you never miss a\r\nword. Later, when you go back to review your\r\nnotes, you can tap anywhere on the page to\r\nbring up the audio that was recorded while\r\nyou were writing at that point in time. This\r\nfunction is made possible by the specialized\r\npaper produced by Livescribe, which has\r\ntiny dots that, much like a connect-the-dots\r\npuzzle, can map out exactly what is written\r\non a page. At the bottom of the paper\r\nare buttons for functions like record, play,\r\nstop, fast-forward and rewind, which allow\r\nthe user to control the audio play-back. The\r\nSmartpen, at about six inches long and twice\r\nas wide as a regular pen, can hold up to two\r\ngigabytes of memory, which means it’s capable\r\nof 150 to 200 hours of recording time—or\r\n60,000 pages of notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written notes can be transferred to a computer\r\nthrough a USB dock and are imported into the\r\nLivescribe’s software interface. From there,\r\nnotes can be organized, manipulated and\r\nshared. The specialized paper enables the software\r\nto animate pen strokes so that the notes\r\nappear on screen the way they were written on\r\npaper. The Smartpen also comes with handwriting\r\nrecognition software, allowing you to\r\nsearch for words in your notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the unique accessories that come with\r\nthe Smartpen is the 3D recording headset. The\r\nheadset looks and functions like a normal pair\r\nof headphones, but on the backside are a pair\r\nof binaural microphones. These microphones\r\nare designed to render sound in the entire audio\r\nfield so that the playback of the audio will\r\nsound exactly the way you experienced it. For\r\nexample, if your professor moves across the\r\nroom while lecturing, you will hear the sound\r\ntransfer from one ear to the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the many benefits of the\r\nSmartpen, engineering students at\r\nUW-Madison aren’t quite sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t think the pen would actually\r\nwork. It doesn’t seem like it’s made\r\nfor math or science,” Jena Lange, a\r\nsenior in engineering mechanics and\r\nastronautics, says. “The find function\r\nwould be difficult to use; it would be\r\na fiasco when it comes to Greek letters\r\nand other symbols.” Jena, like many\r\nother engineering students, has few\r\nnotes with actual words. Most notes\r\nare written mathematically or in vector\r\ndiagrams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Smartpen comes with a 100-\r\npage dotted notebook, a 3D recording\r\nheadset, ink and stylus refills,\r\nUSB cradle, Livescribe Desktop\r\napplication and 250 megabytes\r\nof online storage, selling at $149\r\nfor the one gigabyte model and at\r\n$199 for the two gigabyte model.\r\n“If the Smartpen was more cost\r\nefficient, I would buy it,” Jesse\r\nWeidner, a junior in mechanical\r\nengineering, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many students, the cost of the Smartpen far\r\noutweighs its benefits. Students like John Krippinger\r\nand Adam Krohn, also juniors in mechanical\r\nengineering, agree. “If you miss something\r\nyou can most likely get it from a friend.\r\nYou won’t miss that much that you would need\r\nthis pen,” Adam says. John agrees, adding that\r\nhe wouldn’t spend over $50 for the Smartpen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, the Livescribe Pulse Smartpen may\r\nhave a home with college students, but for now\r\nthe advantages don’t appear to be causing a revolutionary\r\nchange in the way college students take\r\nnotes. Perhaps the Smartpen needs a drop in price\r\nand a more convincing sales pitch for students to\r\ntake advantage of this technical marvel.</p>', 'Bonnie Atkinson', 'Bonnie is a second-year\r\njournalism major.

Now, nine\r\nyears after the start of the competition, employees\r\nfrom all the top snowmobile manufactures\r\ncome to the CSC to check out the\r\ninnovations developed by competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW-Madison joined the CSC in 2002 and\r\nnow participates in two separate clean\r\nsnowmobile competitions. The first of\r\nthese is the internal combustion (IC) competition.\r\nIn this competition, the team uses\r\ntheir Bucky 750 FX, a modified 2003 Polaris\r\nFrontier Classic, powered by a 750cc fourstroke\r\nengine that has been redesigned and\r\nrebuilt as a flex fuel engine to accept E10 to\r\nE85 ethanol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This required a lot of sleepless nights, but\r\nnow, after a few years of doing it, it’s not\r\nas painful and we don’t blow up engines\r\nnearly as often,” Ethan Brodsky, the team\r\nadvisor, says. Along with redesigning the\r\nengine, the team also designed and built\r\ntheir own custom exhaust system with a\r\nthree way catalyst to greatly reduce emissions\r\nof carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.\r\n“With the requirement this year to\r\nrun E85, we were one of only four teams\r\nin the 15 teams competing to pass the CSC\r\nemissions test,” Nick Rakovec, the team\r\nleader, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/FEB09snowmobile1web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"The Snowmobile SAE team from left: Kevin King, Adam Schumacher, Ashley Driver, Brad\r\nHall, Bucky, Nick Rakovec, Michael Maney, Glenn Bower, Michael Peitz and Brian Olenski.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The Snowmobile SAE team from left: Kevin King, Adam Schumacher, Ashley Driver, Brad\r\nHall, Bucky, Nick Rakovec, Michael Maney, Glenn Bower, Michael Peitz and Brian Olenski.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Reducing noise emissions is another big\r\ngoal of the CSC, so along with redesigning\r\ntheir muffler the team spent many\r\nhours reducing the noise being emitted\r\nfrom the tunnel and track of their Bucky\r\n750 FX. This year, the team plans to improve\r\ntheir IC sled design, starting with\r\nthe brand new 2007 Polaris FST chassis.\r\nAnother modification to be incorporated\r\nin the 2009 design is a turbocharger. Rakovec\r\nanticipates the new and improved\r\nBucky 750 FX will be the fastest sled running\r\na turbo this March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years ago, a new category of “Zero\r\nEmissions” was added to the CSC. This category\r\nwas produced by the National Science\r\nFoundation’s need for a vehicle to transport\r\nscientists and equipment in pristine areas of\r\nthe north and south poles for climate and\r\npollution research. Last year, the UW-Madison\r\nCSC team decided to enter the Zero\r\nEmissions (ZE) category and build a completely\r\nelectrically powered snow machine\r\ndubbed BuckEV. The EV suffix came from\r\nthe Delphi EV 1 electric motor, which is the\r\npower source in this exceptionally fast machine.\r\nThe team recalls the huge smiles on\r\nthe judges’ faces at last year’s competition,\r\nwho were overwhelmingly impressed by\r\nthe power that the 100 horsepower engine\r\ngenerated. The power to supply this motor\r\nresults from the 84 28-volt lithium-ion battery\r\npacks, sold to the team by Milwaukee\r\nTools—the team’s sponsor last year—at\r\nproduction cost. Together these batteries\r\nproduce 78 kilowatts of power at 336 volts.\r\n“[This] is enough power to run several houses\r\nwith every single thing in the house running\r\nsimultaneously. At 6.5 kilowatt-hours\r\nyou can run 100 65-watt light bulbs for a full\r\nhour,” Brodsky says. But BuckEV is not just\r\nall brawn. At 50 feet away, this snowmobile\r\nemits only 55 decibels, which is roughly the\r\nnoise level inside the average house.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/FEB09snowmobile6web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"The BuckEV in front of the US Air Force C-130 that carried it to Greenland for competition.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The BuckEV in front of the US Air Force C-130 that carried it to Greenland for competition.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>All the work the team put into BuckEV\r\npaid off when they were crowned the 2008\r\nZE national champion. As a result, they\r\nearned a roundtrip ticket to Summit Station,\r\na National Science Foundation (NSF)\r\nresearch station located at the peak of the\r\nGreenland ice cap, to test the sled’s potential\r\nin aiding arctic research. There the sled\r\nremained for two and a half months, traveling\r\na total distance of over 300 miles. Researchers\r\nkept logs of every trip on Buck-\r\nEV, while the data logger the UW-Madison\r\nteam had installed on board kept track of\r\nits activities. The data showed that BuckEV\r\nwas able to haul a total of 1,800 pounds,\r\nwhich more than doubles the towing capacity\r\nthe sled was designed for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though BuckEV goes above and beyond\r\nthe performance specifications that NSF\r\nsought after, the costs of building the sled\r\nprevent it from becoming readily available.\r\nAccording to Brodsky, the material\r\nand component costs range from $60,000\r\nto $90,000, with the EV1 motor and controller\r\nalone ringing up at nearly $30,000. The\r\nmajority of the supplies and components\r\nthe CSC team uses each year come from\r\nrecycled components from other engineering\r\nprojects and industry donations. With\r\nthe hours of build time required, “[the]\r\nsnowmobile comes out to 100 to 150 thousand\r\ndollars of engineering efforts, which\r\nis actually pretty reasonable for building a\r\nprototype like this,” Brodsky says. Unfortunately,\r\nthese costs are still too high for\r\nthe declining budget of NSF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of impressing the NSF, BuckEV also\r\nimpressed the natives of Alaska at last fall’s\r\nconvention. In Alaska, energy isn’t cheap.\r\nGasoline is at $11 to $12 per gallon. Thus,\r\nthe federal government assists many villages\r\nby putting up windmills and providing\r\nresidents with free electricity. For this\r\nreason, it would be economically advantageous\r\nfor Alaskans to use electric vehicles,\r\nwhich is why one man at the convention\r\neven offered to buy BuckEV for $90,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We demonstrate that it’s not that hard\r\nto make these vehicles cleaner; yet, the\r\nindustry protests and says it’s too hard,”\r\nBrodsky says. One good example of the\r\nCSC impact on the snowmobile industry\r\nis the emissions test. Originally developed\r\nfor the annual competition, the emissions\r\ntest is now used as an industry-wide standard\r\nto test snow machines. “The emissions\r\ntesting used now for industry was\r\ndeveloped over the first three years of this\r\ncompetition,” Brodsky says. “Soon we are\r\ngoing to show everyone that that’s not\r\ngood enough anymore.”</p>', 'Cody Wenzel', 'Cody Wenzel is a transfer\r\nstudent from UW-Lacrosse.

('feb092009febxo', 'XO marks the spot', 'article', '', 'February', 2009, '<p>In a small office on the UW-Madison campus, I sit with Silas Bernardoni, a senior in industrial engineering at UW-Madison, as he sorts through a pile of laptops. The computers are compact, made of hard white plastic and trimmed in lime green. Each one is adorned with a colorful “X” and “O,” which are arranged to form the outline of a child. Appropriately, these computers are called XO laptops, and they are rapidly making their mark on the international\r\ncommunity, as well as on the computing world. Bernardoni pulls out a couple of the laptops and flips them open, talking all the while about the colossal project\r\nsurrounding them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This whole thing is incredible because it’s gone from an idea to a million computers\r\nin the field in three years,” Bernardoni\r\nsays. “The incredible speed with which things are happening is just phenomenal.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He’s talking about One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), a non-profit organization founded four years ago by the head of MIT Media Labs, Nicholas Negroponte. According to the OLPC website, the mission of the organization\r\nis to supply affordable, durable computers to teachers and students around the world to enhance both teaching and learning experiences. Though the project is only a few years old, there are already 11 countries participating and another 18 engaged\r\nin pilot programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After seeing a story about OLPC on the news program “60 Minutes,” former UW-Madison Chancellor John Wiley convinced Negroponte that the XO laptops could also be used effectively for disadvantaged elementary school children in the United States. Negroponte finally agreed, and the program donated 10 laptops to UW-Madison.\r\nThis past summer, Bernardoni, with the help of engineering professional development\r\nprofessors Sandy Courter and George Johnson, put together a pilot program\r\nto explore the ways in which the XO laptops could be used to teach children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We didn’t have any training; we didn’t have anything,” Bernardoni says of the pilot.\r\n“We just had 10 computers and we went out and tried to teach kids.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the pilot, the team observed how the kids reacted to the programs on the XO laptops, deciding which ones worked and which ones didn’t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are hundreds of programs out there, some of which are just horrible,” Bernardoni\r\nsays, referring to the open source software\r\nused by the XO laptops. “It was our job to decide which ones were best to teach literature, which ones were best to teach math and so on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the software used by the XO laptops is open source, meaning it is free to anyone, and users are capable of altering it in any way they see fit. Using such software on the XO laptops allows people from all over the world to write, share and improve the programs found on the XO laptops. These capabilities further emphasize the computer’s\r\nrole as a flexible and innovative learning\r\ntool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exclusive use of open source software is only one facet of the XO laptop that distinguishes\r\nit from a typical Windows or Apple laptop. Physically, the computers are designed to withstand harsh natural conditions of developing countries, from the sandy deserts of Africa to the wet rainforests\r\nof South America. Unlike a fragile Macbook or Dell laptop, the XO laptops are robust enough to withstand a hard fall from a desk or a spilled glass of water. Moreover, each physical component on the XO laptops\r\nhas one or more very specific functions.\r\nTwo latches on the outer edge of the computer, for instance, act as clasps when the computer is shut and as wireless antennas\r\nwhen it’s open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its unique physical design, the software on the XO laptops is completely\r\ndifferent from anything else found on the market. While Apple and Windows computers have their stylistic differences, both systems utilize a similar format in which applications and documents are organized\r\ninto files and folders. However, the software system on the XO laptops, called Sugar, completely does away with this\r\nBy Carrie Boecher\r\nPhoto by Tharn Tantitham\r\nFEATURE\r\nFebruary 2009 11\r\n“desktop metaphor.” Instead, activities—a more child-friendly term for programs—are represented by playful icons and arranged in a circle around an XO child figure on the home screen. All data is saved automatically\r\nin each activity, so there is no need for files and folders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant capabilities of the Sugar software is its mesh network, which allows young students to interact electronically, even without the internet. In the neighborhood view on the laptops, all students using the computers at any given time appear as different colored XO icons. By simply clicking on one of these icons, one student can invite another to collaborate\r\nin a virtual activity, such as painting a picture, playing a game, making music or writing a paper. In this way, a sense of community\r\nis created among the students, and learning becomes a group endeavor rather than an individual task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the XO is how economical it is. According to Bernardoni,\r\na standard introductory laptop costs about $700, while the XO costs only about $180. Even more amazing is the fact that these little computers are produced at the same plants as Windows and Apple laptops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The computer industry doesn’t like it, because\r\nOLPC came around and proved that you can actually [build computers at such a low price],” Bernardoni says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The low price led Chancellor Wiley to purchase\r\n$20,000 worth of the laptops as one of his last acts as chancellor, increasing the UW-Madison collection to 110. These computers\r\nare being used throughout the community\r\nat schools, churches and community\r\ncenters to assess how they can best be used to teach children. Currently Bernardoni\r\nand the other volunteers regularly visit four locations around Madison with the XO laptops, teaching children how to use the computers and observing how the computers\r\nteach the children. Although Bernardoni\r\nand his team have put hundreds of hours into the project, there is a lot of work yet to be done—and they need help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We need people, in this case students, who are interested in this [project] to go out to schools with us and tutor kids. We just sit with [the kids] and help them with their homework, then figure out ways we can use the XO to help them with their work,” Bernardoni says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>n addition to helping in the classroom, UW-Madison students can earn credit for their work with the program. A class in volunteering\r\nwill be offered spring semester of 2009, in which participants will be trained on the XO laptops. Some will even have the opportunity to travel to Paraguay to help start an OLPC branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, however, Bernardoni and others at UW-Madison will continue to assess the value of the XO for underprivileged children\r\nhere in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The whole goal is to find out how to help disadvantaged kids,” Bernardoni says. “The more we can help them, the more [the XO] is successful as an educational tool.”</p>', 'Carrie Boecher', 'Carrie Boecher is a junior in civil and environmental engineering.

At UW-Madison, the Physical\r\nSciences Laboratory (PSL) was created\r\nto address this need.\r\nPSL is located about 14 miles from campus\r\nin Stoughton, WI on grounds that were the\r\nproperty of the Midwestern Universities\r\nResearch Association (MURA) in the 40s\r\nand 50s. In 1967, after MURA came to an\r\nend, it was decided that all of MURA’s assets\r\nand staff would become the property\r\nof UW-Madison. The university named this\r\nnew establishment the Physical Sciences\r\nLaboratory of the University of Wisconsin.\r\nIts mission is to “provide facilities and technical\r\nknowledge to promote education and\r\nresearch.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PSL runs as an engineering consulting\r\nagency available to professors and research\r\nprograms. “We are not an academic department;\r\nwe are a service facility,” Farshid\r\nFeyzi, technical director at PSL, says of\r\nPSL’s relationship with the university. “We\r\ndon’t get any money [directly] from the university,\r\nalthough we get the building and\r\nwe don’t pay for electricity. We do charge\r\nfor our time and for all of our services and\r\nmaterials,” John Morgan, PSL’s marketing\r\ndirector, adds that “it [PSL] is part of the\r\nUW, but it supports itself.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/two.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Several members of the Physical Sciences Laboratory from left: Harold Mattison, Dan Wenman, Dan Wahl, Farshid Feyzi, Lee\r\nGreenler, Jack Ambuel and Ken Kriesel.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Several members of the Physical Sciences Laboratory from left: Harold Mattison, Dan Wenman, Dan Wahl, Farshid Feyzi, Lee\r\nGreenler, Jack Ambuel and Ken Kriesel.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The type of engineering services that\r\nPSL provides is what makes it such an\r\nexceptional institution. “The unique\r\nthing about PSL is that it’s really, really,\r\nhighly specialized in working with researchers,”\r\nMorgan says.

Researchers at PSL\r\nare typically always working on at least\r\none long-term and complicated project\r\nthat may involve many other collaborators.\r\nIn addition, there are also a variety\r\nof smaller consulting projects that PSL\r\ntakes on.

The collimator\r\nis now distributed worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PSL has also been involved in global\r\ngovernment research initiatives involving\r\nthe development and construction\r\nof the largest scientific instrument ever\r\nmade—the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\r\nat The European Council for Nuclear\r\nResearch in Switzerland. The LHC is a\r\nparticle accelerator 100 meters underground\r\nthat is used to study the smallest\r\nbuilding blocks of all types of matter.\r\nAccording to The European Council’s\r\nwebsite, the LHC recreates the conditions\r\nimmediately after the big bang by\r\ncolliding particle beams of very high\r\nenergy. The particles are then analyzed\r\nby physicists using two kinds of special\r\ndetectors. One of these two detectors is\r\nthe Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS). The\r\nCMS consists of a huge superconducting\r\ncoil that creates a magnetic field (a solenoid)\r\nabout 100,000 times stronger than\r\nthe earth’s magnetic field. This particular\r\ncomponent of the LHC caused quite a bit\r\nof controversy among scientists who predicted\r\nthat the mini black holes and magnetic\r\nmonopoles that were created would\r\ncause doomsday.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb09/images/five.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"A component of a digital optical module used in the IceCube project, which allows\r\nfor accurate drilling of holes in polar ice up to 2,500 meters thick.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">A component of a digital optical module used in the IceCube project, which allows\r\nfor accurate drilling of holes in polar ice up to 2,500 meters thick.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In this research initiative, PSL was given\r\nthe job of designing and constructing the\r\ntwo end caps of the CMS.

The caps contain\r\nover two million hair-like wires for detection\r\nof particles and 310,000 electric channels.\r\nThe largest feat of constructing the\r\nCMS was that each of its fully constructed\r\ncomponents had to be lowered 100 meters\r\nunderground and then assembled\r\ntogether. PSL was responsible not only\r\nfor the design of the end caps but also the\r\ndesign and supervision of the construction\r\nof each part and the lowering procedure.\r\nThis was a very successful project for the\r\nlab, and, according to PSL, each end cap\r\nwas lowered underground without breaking\r\na single wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another large research project that PSL is\r\ninvolved in is the Global IceCube project\r\nin the South Pole.

However, troubleshooting\r\nsuch a chemical reactor requires an approach\r\nother than turning dials in a control\r\nroom. That is why Regina Murphy,\r\nprofessor of chemical engineering at\r\nUW-Madison, has been working hard to\r\nuncover the chemical basis of neurodegenerative\r\ndiseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\nMurphy never would have guessed\r\nshe would become a professor of chemical\r\nengineering. “In high school I was\r\nmuch more interested in English,” Murphy\r\nsays. Swayed by her high school\r\nchemistry teacher and friends, however,\r\nMurphy applied to her hometown university,\r\nthe Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology (MIT). Murphy entered college\r\nundecided on a major. But it was a\r\nchemical engineering elective class her\r\nfirst year that struck her interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a BS in chemical engineering from\r\nMIT, Murphy moved to California to\r\nwork at a Chevron oil refinery, where she\r\nsays she spent her days “climbing through\r\ndistillation columns and worrying about\r\nhydrogen balances.” After five years at\r\nthe refinery, Murphy came back to MIT to\r\nearn her PhD in chemical engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Murphy finished graduate school,\r\nshe felt the call of academia and applied\r\nfor professorships at several universities.\r\n“I had no intention of coming to Wisconsin,\r\nbut I decided I would come and interview\r\nanyway—for practice,” Murphy\r\nsays. When she arrived, however, she\r\nwas attracted to UW-Madison’s diverse\r\nand quality chemical engineering faculty.\r\nShe was also pleasantly surprised by\r\nthe city which she thought was “neat.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april09/img/APR09professorprofile3web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Professor Regina Murphy works under a bio-safety hood, in order to keep materials sterile during her research.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Regina Murphy works under a bio-safety hood, in order to keep materials sterile during her research. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years after Murphy began teaching\r\nat UW-Madison, the chemical engineering\r\ndepartment decided to restructure\r\nits introductory courses. At the time, the\r\nfirst course in the\r\ncurriculum was\r\nCBE 210: Chemical\r\nEngineering Calculations.\r\nMurphy\r\nsays she thought\r\nthat was a boring\r\ntitle. She thought\r\nback to the influential\r\nchemical engineering\r\ncourse she\r\ntook as a freshman\r\nat MIT. Instead of\r\nteaching first year\r\nstudents just how\r\nto calculate mass\r\nand heat flows\r\non existing processes,\r\nshe wanted\r\nto teach students\r\nwhy and how new\r\nprocesses are developed.\r\nThe mass\r\nand energy balance\r\ncalculations\r\nwere to be incorporated\r\ninto this new\r\nframework. The new course, CBE 250,\r\nwas given the more elegant title of her\r\nMIT course: Process Synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBE 250 has proven to be a great success.\r\nMurphy says that, in designing the\r\ncourse, she “wanted students to know\r\nhow to read flow charts and know about\r\nequipment—what [chemical engineering]\r\nis all about.” The book she subsequently\r\nwrote for the course is being\r\nused in introductory classes at universities\r\nwith well-known chemical engineering\r\nprograms such as the California\r\nInstitute of Technology, the University\r\nof Minnesota and Cornell University. It has also been translated into Spanish and\r\nKorean. Students find the information\r\nin the course very useful for their coops\r\nand internships. At a recent Clorox\r\nco-op information session, ten chemical\r\nengineering students were asked which\r\nclass was their favorite, and the first five\r\nresponses were CBE 250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy’s research for the past several\r\nyears has been focused on trying to figure\r\nout the roots of haywire chemical reactions\r\nthat may cause neurodegenerative\r\ndiseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\r\nThe chemical reactions of interest\r\nare those of protein aggregation. It is\r\nbelieved aggregated (clumped) proteins\r\ncan sometimes attack cell membranes,\r\nkilling the cell tissue. Murphy says, “We\r\nare making some real progress in figuring\r\nout why these proteins aggregate and\r\nwhat the mechanism is.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a collaboration with Jeff Johnson\r\nin the UW-Madison department of pharmacy,\r\nMurphy’s team has hypothesized\r\nthat a certain protein, called transthyretin,\r\nmay help protect against the damaging\r\nâ-amyloid aggregates (toxic kinetic\r\nintermediates). Recent tests indicate\r\nthat a specific amino acid\r\nmutation in transthyretin has\r\nan effect on its ability to protect\r\ntissues. This mutation may be\r\nage-related and further analysis\r\nmay explain why certain people\r\ndevelop neurodegenerative diseases\r\nat an older age. “I’m really\r\nexcited about the potential for\r\ndiscovering why this protein is\r\nprotective and whether or not\r\n[we] can manipulate that somehow,”\r\nMurphy says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her free time, Murphy enjoys\r\nspending time with her two\r\nteenage children, playing sports\r\nand running.

General aviation is classified\r\nas non-commercial, non-revenue generating\r\nflights, encompassing recreational and private\r\npilots. Statistically, this area of aviation\r\ntends to be the most accident-prone. Thus,\r\nthe simulator is being used to assess how effective\r\nthe current training methods are and\r\nhow they may be modified to make recreational\r\naviation safer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are working on understanding how\r\npilots make decisions in dynamic situations\r\nthat involve uncertainty about what\r\nthe correct course of action should be. Particularly,\r\nin our lab we are looking at dynamic\r\ndecision-making related to changes\r\nin weather conditions and how pilots respond\r\nin-flight to those dynamic changes,”\r\nWiegmann says. The goal is for pilots to be\r\nable to assess how the weather is changing\r\nand effectively decide if such a change\r\nmight jeopardize their safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Most of the fatal accidents that occur\r\ntend to involve adverse weather conditions,”\r\nWiegmann says. This has led him\r\nto focus the initial stage of his research\r\nwith the flight simulator on dynamic\r\nweather systems. To study the decisionmaking\r\nprocess, test pilots are set to fly\r\na designated course and are given all of\r\nthe information that would normally be\r\navailable to them upon take off. Once the\r\nsimulation has started, the weather patterns\r\nin the simulator change. The pilots\r\nmust rely on visual cues to assess the situation\r\nand decide whether to adjust their\r\ncourse of action or continue on the flight\r\npath as planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../april09/img/APR09pilotdecision2web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"The flight simulator used in Professor Wiegmann’s study dons a three-screen,\r\npanoramic view that has all of the instrumentation of a modern light aircraft.\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The flight simulator used in Professor Wiegmann’s study dons a three-screen,\r\npanoramic view that has all of the instrumentation of a modern light aircraft. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In general aviation, early warning indicators\r\nabout changing and inclement weather\r\nare often limited to simple visual assessments\r\nmade by the pilot and other pilots’\r\nchatter on the radio. Weather changes are\r\noften gradual and pilots can find themselves\r\nlong distances from their origin and\r\ndestination while the weather is changing.\r\nRecreational pilots rely heavily on simply\r\n“looking up ahead and thinking, ‘how far\r\naway is that cloud?’ and ‘how high is it?’\r\n… But, generally, people are not that good\r\nat estimating cloud ceiling and visibility,”\r\nWiegmann says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is some technology that is becoming\r\nmore and more available; obviously\r\nthey have GPS for navigation … some aircraft\r\ncome installed with weather hazard\r\ndisplays … if you link that with your GPS\r\nyou can see where you are at relative to the\r\nweather,” Wiegmann says. There are some\r\ndrawbacks, however, to additional electronic\r\ndisplays in the cockpit. Specifically,\r\nthese systems can cause pilots to fly in a\r\nmore “heads-down” position, which takes\r\naway from visual scanning of the surroundings.\r\n“There is some evidence that\r\nis coming out of our laboratory that shows\r\npilots who have these displays are more\r\nlikely to push the envelope because they\r\nhave more information and so they think,\r\n‘I’ve got this technology, it’s going to help\r\nme figure out how to do this or it’s going to\r\nkeep me out of trouble,’ when it may not.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The goal is to … study how pilots make\r\ndecisions, but to also create scenarios that\r\nare used to train pilots on the ground,\r\nwhich is safer than in the air,” Wiegmann\r\nsays. His team plans to come up with different\r\nscenario-based programs that help\r\ntrain pilots to make better decisions. These\r\nsimulations, which are similar to those\r\nused in commercial aviation, can then be\r\nused to test whether pilots have learned\r\nto deal with hazardous situations as they\r\nhave been trained. The simulator can also\r\nbe used to test new technology, such as a\r\nnew weather hazard display.

The American Society of Heating,\r\nRefrigerating and Air-conditioning\r\nEngineers (ASHRAE) sets standards for\r\nenergy use in the building. “Our current\r\nenergy modeling puts us about 40 percent\r\nbetter than ASHRAE [standards],”\r\nBroadhead says. “There will be energy recovery\r\nventilation in the H-VAC systems,\r\nvariable speed fume hoods and recovery\r\nsystems on the refrigerator,” Josh Clements,\r\nchair of UW-Madison’s Emerging\r\nGreen Builders, says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold certification from the U.S Green\r\nBuilding Council’s Leadership in Energy\r\nand Environmental Design (LEED) is also being sought, with silver certification\r\nbeing the minimum goal. “With a multipurpose\r\nbuilding, LEED certification is\r\ndifficult,” Broadhead says. “The building\r\nserves different purposes every day, but\r\nwe are aiming for gold.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The university is also working with the\r\nMadison Environmental Group to make\r\nsure the highest possible amount of material\r\nis salvaged and recycled from the\r\ndemolition.

Wisely realizing that I probably\r\nwouldn’t be able to save all of the world, I decided\r\nto focus on just saving the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on, it was clear that this would be no\r\nsimple task. In freshman environmental\r\nstudies classes, I watched with distress as\r\npie charts and bar graphs flashed before\r\nmy eyes, detailing the ecological horrors we\r\nwere bringing upon ourselves. There’s no\r\nmore room for garbage! The land in sinking\r\nfrom groundwater depletion! We’re going to\r\nrun out of oil in less than 100 years! Florida\r\nis drowning!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistics were terrifying and motivating.\r\nSomething had to be done, and I had to\r\nbe to one to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first step towards saving the planet was\r\nto pick up an environmental engineering\r\nmajor. Not only did this degree allow me\r\nto keep with my engineering studies (as if\r\nI had just suffered through calculus two for\r\nnothing), it had the word “environmental”\r\nin the title—automatic earth-saving points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, I started to unplug my toaster, and\r\nI replaced my light bulbs with compact fluorescents.\r\nNext, I dusted off the old Schwinn\r\nand learned to navigate the streets of Madison\r\nby bicycle. I also splurged on reusable\r\nshopping bags from Trader Joe’s and an\r\naluminum water bottle from Whole Foods.\r\nI even tried becoming a vegetarian, but\r\nfailed on the second day when my roommate\r\npointed out that the sausage on the pizza I\r\nwas eating was, in fact, a pork product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But time has worn on, and despite my best\r\nefforts, Earth continues to roar towards destruction\r\nat hyper speed. Every time I flip on\r\nthe news there’s either a new Nevada-sized\r\nchunk breaking off the Arctic Ice Shelf or a\r\nfamily of whooping cranes being displaced\r\nby suburban land development in Texas.\r\nWatching these bulletins, I’ve slowly realized\r\nthat even if everyone did care, and even\r\nif everyone reused their shopping bags and\r\nchanged their light bulbs, it still wouldn’t be\r\nenough to save the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what would be enough? What would we\r\nhave to do to save the planet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This past fall, I listened to a lecture on the\r\nimportance of liquid biofuels for both national\r\nsecurity and the environment. When\r\nasked about those who criticized the use of\r\nethanol, the lecturer laughed and said, “Do\r\nyou know how those people suggest we\r\nsave the environment? They suggest we cut\r\ndown the population and start from scratch.\r\nTo them, it’s the only way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience chuckled a bit; I’m almost\r\npositive no one in that auditorium was\r\nready to sacrifice himself for the Arctic Ice\r\nShelf. But theoretically, I thought, that is\r\njust about the only way we completely can\r\nfix this mess. How do we expect to purify\r\nour air and earth and water if we keep consuming\r\never-waning resources and producing\r\ndisposable junk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realistically, however, very few of us are\r\nwilling to give up our hot showers, microwavable\r\nmeals and insulated homes. The\r\naforementioned ethanol opponents might\r\nbe correct when they we have to start from\r\nscratch. But let’s be real. That’s simply not\r\ngoing to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, I’ve realized, is where engineering\r\ncomes in. It turns out that my first step towards\r\nsaving the planet—picking up that\r\nenvironmental engineering degree—was\r\nalso the most important. Engineers tend to\r\nbe realistic people; we understand the feasibility\r\n(or lack thereof) of any given idea.\r\nDestroying the current infrastructure and\r\neliminating a large fraction of the human\r\npopulation? Not very feasible. Using science\r\nand technology to improve on our current\r\npractices? Definitely feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, engineering isn’t quite synonymous\r\nwith saving the earth. As a friend\r\nonce joked of my major, “Isn’t environmental\r\nengineering an oxymoron?” He’s kind\r\nof right; development, by nature, takes its\r\ntoll on the planet. Sustainable engineering,\r\nthen, becomes a compromise—a compromise\r\nbetween the needs of the present and\r\nthe fate of the future.

There are a plethora of options for getting out and seeing the world beyond the borders of Dane, and there is no time like the present, being young able-bodied curious college students, to cut free and travel the globe. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI have been fortunate to catch the traveler’s bug early in my healthy six-year undergraduate career, and have capitalized on most every opportunity to travel on a begged or borrowed dollar. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese are just a few of the many opportunities which I feel fortunate to have capitalized upon.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/matt.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"Matt Stauffer\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStudent organizations are an engaging means of getting out for a long weekend of self-enlightening travel. At UW-Madison, we have the Hoofers organization which is about making friends, pushing your personal limits and traveling around this blessed country in search of an adrenaline rush. I have taken a weekend to go jump out of a fully functional airplane and jumped on a chartered bus to get up into the waist-deep powder of Jackson Hole. Whichever activity tickles your fancy, Hoofers is bound to have a club that does it and a trip that goes there. \r\n</p><p>  \r\nOther organizations such as the Associated Students of Madison, Leadershape, Engineers Without Boarders, this magazine, and other esoteric organizations on campus have national, and sometimes international, conferences where you can meet peers from other universities. These excursions are a great networking opportunity, as well as a lot of fun. Also, they are often fully sponsored by the organization provided you are present for the educational bit of the long weekend. I have been imbursed to travel to Detroit, Pittsburg, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. through various clubs and organizations. \r\nAs international borders and the great expanse of water that separates America from Eurasia have become less of an obstacle to the great human shuffle, cross-cultural communication has become integral to many international education curriculums. With that said, English is becoming the global language. Being a native English speaker has been my key to free trips around the world. I spent one summer teaching in The Kingdom of Tonga and another in Japan. Many countries abroad including Japan, China, Korea, Spain, France, Germany and Mexico prompt their children to learn English in school.  These schools often seek college students to teach their children to speak English and there are many programs which often include a living stipend and free travel; some actually come with a paycheck. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEngineers in training are encouraged to get hands-on experience through work-study internships. This is another great opportunity to get outside of the comfortable Wisco-shell and travel to a new location. A co-op with Kimberly Clark was my travel ticket to the Pacific Northwest, where I got my khakis dirty on the factory floor. Exploring options within a particular company will reveal these travel opportunities. If the company is large enough, chances are they will have available positions in national or international facilities. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlways popular amongst students is the semester abroad option. Whether the goal is immersion in a foreign language or just a change of pace, a semester abroad will undoubtedly lead to a new group of friends and broader world views. For engineers, this is a chance to work on an international engineering project or to crawl out of the engineering pigeonhole for a six-month breath of fresh liberal studies air. A semester in New Zealand allowed me to explore courses in biology and environmental studies, see an amazing corner of planet Earth and meet a gang of new friends, all while fulfilling several liberal requirements.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are innumerable opportunities available to travel tangled up in the network of college life. It may seem overwhelming to sort the details out, but all of the resources necessary are available on campus or a click away on the net. With flexibility and compassion, few expectations and an open mind, these stints of world travel have become a glorious collection of collegiate memories and a valuable asset to my future career on the global engineering stage.</p> \r\n<p>\r\nHappy travels,<br />\r\nMatt Stauffer</p>', 'Matt Stauffer', '', 'Anna Mielke', 'Eric Harris', '2009-09-03', NULL);

Since coming to UW-Madison ten years ago, however, Schauer has made a name for himself in providing policy-relevant research in the areas of air pollution and lake mercury levels in Wisconsin. In 2008, Schauer was the recipient of UW-Madison’s H. I. Romnes Faculty Award, given to faculty who demonstrate significant effort in policy-relevant research.\r\nAdditionally, Schauer’s passion for collaborating with people from various backgrounds has allowed him to become an influential member in the Madison area. He has served as the director of the UW-Madison Water Science Engineering Laboratory and the program director of the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/globe1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Schauer demonstrates the lab-based mercury analyzer, one of the tools he often uses when analyzing lake water in Wisconsin.</div>\r\n</div><p>\r\n\\"A big part of my job is to be a facilitator … I’m trying to help students learn about [pollutant characterization] tools so they can go on to work for the government or with researchers in universities or industry … but also to help with other researchers around the country,” Schauer says. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSchauer’s current research group uses chemical characterization tools to analyze pollutants in the atmosphere, find their sources and describe their impacts on human health. This information is then used by policy-makers when deciding which strategies to pursue to best reduce the impact of pollution. The challenge Schauer’s group most frequently encounters is finding the sources of this pollution.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Because we study the atmosphere, our laboratory is the world,” Schauer says. “When you go places there’s lots of pollution … it’s very difficult to do forensics to understand where those sources are.” These sources can range from diesel exhaust to cholesterol released from meat processing plants. \r\n</p><p>\r\n“A big part of my job is to help us all as a team [and] advance our understanding [of pollutants],” Schauer says. In his role as a collaborator, Schauer directs the attention of policy-makers and researchers across the United States to relevant research papers to help them solve problems of characterizing pollutants.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSchauer’s work has brought him across the globe, working with other researchers to find ways to decrease the impact of air pollution. He has served as a guest professor in China, where he worked with the government to find ways to reduce pollution levels while preparing for the Beijing Olympic Games.

He grew up intrigued with chemistry and math; these interests later fueled his desire to major in chemical and petroleum refining engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. “Engineering was much more attractive [than just studying science],” Schauer says of his undergraduate experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter graduation, Schauer decided to take on the challenges of a career in engineering and moved straight into industry. He managed to land a unique and challenging job working on huge petrochemical plants. \r\n</p><p>\r\n“When I was in my late twenties, I was responsible for starting up … billion dollar complexes, [which] was a great experience,” Schauer says. This job took him across the globe, allowing him to visit Greece, Austria, China, Nigeria and South Asia over a six year period. For Schauer, this tremendous experience improved his skills as a problem solver and allowed him to develop his role as a collaborator, which is how he sees himself today.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSchauer accrued enough vacation time working on these petrochemical complexes that he was able to take a year’s paid vacation. This unique opportunity allowed him to switch to a field he found to be more rewarding: environmental engineering. After receiving his masters at the University of California–Berkeley, Schauer worked in China for six months in a research development center. It was not until a couple years later, while working for his PhD at the California Institute of Technology, that he became interested in teaching.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/globe3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Underneath a fume hood, Schauer works with one of the rotary evaporators to prepare a sample for his research.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a huge knowledge base in emissions characterization, Schauer moved to Madison and took up his current role as a professor, researcher and collaborator. Schauer and his research group also act as environmental ambassadors, providing policy-relevant research on mercury levels in Wisconsin and around the United States. Their recent work provided a scientific basis for The National Resources Board to pass a new regulation on mercury reductions in Wisconsin. He and his group have also studied mercury emissions from geysers in Yellowstone Nation Park, as well as in lakes around Detroit and St. Louis.\r\nSchauer is a man to whom the department of civil and environmental engineering owes a few pats on the back.

('sep09fountain', 'There\\''s No Fountain Like Maquina Fountain', 'article', '', 'September', 2009, '<p>Over the past fifteen years, the Máquina fountain has become an iconic structure for the college of engineering. The semi-circular arcs of the fountain are splashed across the college’s websites and brochures. Many students even view the fountain as a symbol of their engineering education.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/fountain1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Students are able to control the flow of the Máquina Fountain jets, either with the touch screen in Engineering Hall or by walking past the posts lining Engineering Drive.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s a big graduation tradition to go get your picture taken in front of [the fountain],” Chris Meyer, a member of the student organization Enlight, says. Enlight is a small student organization interested in computer and electronic technologies. Members of Enlight tend to the 18-foot tall Máquina fountain. Despite its important status as the centerpiece of the engineering campus, little is known about the many characteristics that make the fountain unique. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe fountain was unveiled in 1994, the result of a collaboration between artist William Conrad Severson and former college of engineering dean John Bollinger. Severson, a UW-Madison alumnus, created a concept that merged art with engineering. The result is a massive steel structure with streams of water shooting out of the two arcs, which are designed to resemble calipers (an engineer’s precise measurement tool). After spraying from the fountain, the water flows down a spillway, runs over small dams called weirs and then disappears underground. Another part of the fountain is independently controlled, sending water down a separate spillway that drains into a reflecting pool. Arching jets of water at the edges of the reflecting pool surround a bubble tower that introduces compressed air bubbles into a water column.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe fountain was always intended to be a vehicle for practical design experience. During Bollinger’s term, electrical engineering design courses challenged students to add new functions to the fountain. However, when Bollinger left, the fountain was handed off to other engineering staff members, and it eventually fell into a state of disrepair. “For years, it just never ran. It was one of the big elephants on campus. Students would wonder ‘Is it ever going to be on?’” Meyer says.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/fountain2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The pipe system underneath the Maquina Fountain extends across the length of Engineering Mall, supplying water to both fountains.   </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nThe fountain remained dormant until Enlight took over as “fountain technicians,” member Justin Beck says. Enlight’s first objective was to get the fountain working again. This seemingly simple task quickly proved complicated, requiring the team to piece together the hardware left behind from past engineering students. When asked about their biggest achievement on the fountain project, Enlight members overwhelmingly respond, “[the fact that] it works.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce the water started flowing again, Enlight members channeled their efforts into several new projects. First, engineering technology company National Instruments donated their CompactRIO control system to replace the old system. This massive change involved “ripping out the fifteen-year-old electrical system and upgrading it with a new one,” Beck says. Second, new server architecture was implemented, which makes the controls much more user-friendly. “Small changes that used to take hours … can now be made in minutes without really having to know the guts of the system,” Malinowski says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe technological advances of the fountain’s controls have paved the way for projects that allow public interaction with the fountain. Many of these interactive ideas were part of the original plan for the fountain that are finally being implemented. The first interactive project allows passersby to unknowingly control the fountain as they walk in front of the bollards, which are the five stainless-steel posts in front of the fountain. \r\n“If anyone thought they were controlling the fountain with the bollards before July 2008, you were wrong. It was just a placebo,” Malinowski says. The bollards are now programmed to detect infrared light emitted by pedestrians and send signals to the fountain, changing the spraying pattern as a person passes each bollard. “There’s one that will turn everything on, there’s one that will turn everything off, one [that] makes it go faster and one [that] makes it go slower,” Malinowski says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnother advance in the controls allows students to control the fountain from inside Engineering Hall. In August 2008, a kiosk was installed in Engineering Hall that allows students to turn specific jets on and off using the touch screen mounted in the lobby. Students can manipulate the valves and watch the results live through the large glass windows encasing the lobby.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/fountain3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Enlight, a student organization, manages and controls the Maquina Fountain. From left: Justin Beck, Christopher Beley, Eric Harris, Jason Malinowski, Chris Meyer and Dustin Passofaro.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nFor special events, such as home football games and Engineering Expo, the fountain turns into a musical display. On the day of a homecoming football game, for instance, Badger fans walking past the fountain can hear “If You Want to be a Badger” and other UW-Madison marching band recordings playing from speakers on Engineering Hall. As the music is played, the valves open and close, changing the spraying pattern in time with the music. Fans can change the song with a quick wave of the hand in front of the bollards.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe idea of combining music and water arose when the Enlight members discovered the speakers atop Engineering Hall. “[Malinowski, Meyer and I] had a history of doing music and lights. The fountain added a new twist to it, because now … we could do music and water,” Beck says. They hope to continue this show during football games this fall, but the demolition of Union South will push game-day festivities onto Engineering Mall, leaving the decision outside the jurisdiction of college of engineering officials.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEnlight members view their work on the fountain as valuable, real-world design experience. “[Most class work] is all in theory. We would never see it actually working. Here, we see the design process. We see how to program it, how to implement it and how the software interacts with physical devices,” Enlight member Dustin Passofaro says. Throughout the design process, Enlight members rely on each others’ expertise, helping each other gain “a jack-of-all-trades mastery,” as Beck says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThanks to the design work of past and present students, the fountain has become an enduring symbol of the engineering campus. The next time you’re eating lunch on the steps of the fountain or snapping those memorable graduation pictures, take a minute to stop and appreciate the unique characteristics of the Máquina.</p>', 'Amanda Feest', 'Amanda is a senior in biomedical engineering.

Thanks to two former UW-Madison students, you can now also get a decent night’s sleep.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nDaniel Gartenberg and his business partner, Justin Beck, looked for a way to improve how people sleep and wake up. “Sleep is basically unaddressed,” Gartenberg says. “There are all these products for fitness and health but not really for sleep.”  \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/iphone1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Proactive Sleep works like a normal alarm clock but knows when to wake the user so that he or she does not feel groggy. Once awake, the user can log the quality of sleep gotten that night. [Image Courtesy of Proactive Sleep]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe duo’s different areas of study made for a successful partnership to fill this void. Gartenberg, who has a degree in psychology and neuroscience from UW-Madison, has the knowledge and resources to improve the way people sleep and wake up. Beck, with his degree in electrical and computer engineering, takes those ideas and puts them to work through the tedious task of computer programming.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter an intensive amount of studying how sleep works and computer programming, Gartenberg and Beck entered their product, named Proactive Sleep, into the Innovation Days competition this February. Their design won first place—an award of $10,000—and the duo gained instant recognition across campus. \r\n</p><p>\r\nProactive Sleep, an application for Apple’s iPhone and iPod touch, has several revolutionary functions. First, there is a sleep diary which allows users to track the amount of sleep received each night and the amount of times woken up each night. Then, there is a “vigilance task” each morning that measures alertness and judges response time to determine the quality of sleep the previous night. The alarm clock also works with the media on the iPhone or iPod touch to provide plenty of song choices to which users can wake up and fall asleep.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe sleep diary is a simple way for users to make sure they are getting enough sleep. “Americans are generally under slept,” Gartenberg says, “Sleep affects every system in the body. You are more likely to get sick and to be overweight if you do not get enough sleep.” \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/iphone2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Justin Beck and Daniel Gartenberg, creators of Proactive Sleep and recent graduates from UW-Madison, show off their innovative idea in their company headquarters (a.k.a. Justin’s apartment).</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nThe diary tracks and graphs information on sleep duration, average amount of sleep per day, number of awakenings and the vigilance test score. There is also a function that allows the user to input information about day-to-day happenings that may have affected sleep that night or input information about dreams. To reap all the benefits of the system, users must be willing to put in some effort and regularly enter data, but the two creators fully believe it could revolutionize the way people wake up in the morning. \r\n</p><p>  \r\nThe vigilance task, is a game played when woken up in the morning. The user simply follows a moving ball around the screen with his or her finger. The quicker the user follows the ball, the quicker it moves and a score is given based on reaction time and alertness. The score is then logged in the diary and provides the key to determining how well the user has slept over time.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce all of the information is stored in the diary, this application is an excellent way for a person to see how different activities or actions can affect a night’s sleep. Therefore a user can self diagnose any problems he or she is having and correct them. For example, if a user logs what time he or she is eating dinner at night, it may be seen that there is a pattern with the number of awakenings or vigilance scores that correspond with a particular eating time. It is a tool for someone to optimize his or her life and get the most out of the sleep gotten each night.   \r\n</p><p>\r\nA final function of the application tracks the amount of sleep the user is getting. It is a simple way for someone to make sure they are getting enough. The system takes the amount of sleep a person is getting over time and applies that to the suggested wake up time as well to have him or her sleep longer if needed. “If someone is sleep deprived, the application is not going to tell the user to wake up at 5:00 if they set 5:30 on their alarm clock,” Gartenberg says. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAn iPhone application is a feasible way for Proactive Sleep to reach the general public. “The nice thing is with the iPhone there are about 50 million devices in the world, and Apple allows you to basically ship an application to them and they distribute the application to everyone,” Beck says. Moreover, people that own iPhones and iPod touches are a good market for this application. “People with iPhones are often trying to optimize their lives, and they have the desire to be productive,” Gartenberg says. \r\n</p><p>\r\n “We just want to educate the world on how to get better sleep, provide them with a feedback tool for them to understand their sleep and build awareness about the issue,” Beck says. Thanks to this dynamic duo’s hard work, a decent night’s sleep may soon be at your fingertips.</p>', 'Roxanne Wienkes', 'Roxanne is a senior studying environmental engineering.

NyQuil and Halls can mask the symptoms of a viral infection, but these drugs do nothing to attack the virus itself. Recent discoveries about the genome of the common cold virus, however, could contribute towards a new immunization for this virus. So what’s the problem? Well, it turns out that the side effects of a common cold vaccination could be far more unpleasant than temporarily suffering with a leaky face.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/cold1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Brad Brown enjoys his work at the UW-Madison Institute for Molecular Virology at Bock Laboratory, despite the risk of contracting the avian flu, swine flu or rhinovirus. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>  \r\nUW-Madison biochemistry professor Ann Palmenberg, along with teams of researchers from UW-Madison and the University of Maryland, successfully mapped and identified all 99 unique strains of the rhinovirus, the lead culprit associated with the common cold. New research methods, such as gene chip technology, have also led to the discovery of a third type of rhinovirus strain, which could offer greater insight into the development of vaccines against the virus.\r\n</p><p> \r\nThe three different types of the rhinovirus are commonly called types A, B and C. The virus strains of types A and B cause symptoms of the common cold, while the type C strain—which has only recently been identified—tends to have more serious effects and often progresses into pneumonia. \r\n</p><p> \r\nBefore more advanced viral assessment methods were developed, doctors used to take cell samples from sick patients who showed signs of a viral infection and then make a culture with those cells. If a virus grew in the culture, the symptoms would be attributed to the virus. When this process was used on samples of pneumonia—a known virus—the cells wouldn’t culture any virus. It turns out that type C rhinovirus does not readily grow with common culture techniques. In fact, this whole strain of type C rhinovirus had been overlooked until gene chip technology came along.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/cold2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Pharmaceutical companies rely on profits from the plethora of symptom masking over-the-counter drugs such as Robitussin and Sudafed. These products are currently the best option for those suffering through a cold. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \r\nGene chip technology is a method that identifies viruses by their genome sequence. Once researchers began to employ this technology, they were able to identify the known A and B strains, but they also discovered other present strains. These new strains were clearly rhinoviruses, but they had slightly different genome sequences. \r\n</p><p> \r\n“Now that we do things with gene chips, we don’t ask the virus to grow; we ask whether the gene sequence is there,” Palmenberg says. After researchers discovered the viral material present in those samples that previously did not grow in culture, they went in for a closer look. It was then that, a whole new set of type C rhinovirus strains were identified by their unique genomes. \r\n</p><p> \r\n“There is a huge amount of biochemistry that comes out of this information,” Palmenberg says. The discovery of the new rhinovirus strain is most useful in the development of a virus database, as well as diagnostic tools that doctors and researchers can use to accurately diagnose sick patients by identifying the specific viral strains from their genome. With the patient’s case-specific viral strain identified, doctors will be better able to treat cold symptoms and have access to early warning signs of more serious cases. \r\n“By understanding the sequence variations in the A’s and the B’s, we can extrapolate to what is going to happen with the C’s … which are much more pathogenic. They don’t just give you head colds; they give pneumonia, which, for someone with asthma, is a life threatening situation,” Palmenberg says.\r\n</p><p> \r\nThe next phase of Palmenberg’s research is to separate and culture the C strains with new culture methods. Prior to this research, virologists and doctors had possibly misdiagnosed viral infections because they were unable to identify type C rhinoviruses with the widely used culture techniques. \r\n</p><p> \r\nThe taxonomy, or family tree, of the rhinovirus includes some particularly nasty viral genera including polio, foot and mouth disease and hepatitis A. However, developing a cure for rhinovirus has been more difficult than it was for other diseases. With polio, for example, a vaccine was easy to develop because there were only three strains, as compared to the ninety-nine unique strains of the rhinovirus. Also, unlike most cases of the rhinovirus, the effects of polio are life-threatening, justifying a significant amount of acceptable risk for preventative treatment. \r\n</p><p> \r\nStill, the similarities between rhinovirus and polio have led to a general misconception about developing a “cure-all” vaccine that would allow people to avoid catching colds. Preemptively going after the rhinovirus may not be a good option, as the risks currently outweigh the rewards. \r\n</p><p> \r\n“If you are going to treat a virus, you have to make sure that whatever you are doing is not worse than the disease itself,” Palmenberg says. “With rhinovirus that is a problem, because almost all of the drugs we have that go after the various viral proteins will either make you sicker than the head cold, or will interfere with drugs you are already taking.” Of course, there may be exceptions. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/cold3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Virus laden cell samples are placed in an electrophoresis unit to separate the genetic material for further analysis. </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \r\n“If you’ve got a kid in the hospital with viral pneumonia and he can’t breathe … then it makes sense to go after the virus,” Palmenberg says. The balance between attacking the virus and risking other health problems associated with prophylactic treatment is different for such a serious case. In these rare instances, this new information acquired from the rhinovirus genome will allow doctors to attack the specific virus that is causing the illness.\r\n</p><p> \r\nThough we will all likely have to trudge through the doldrums of cold symptoms in the future, we can find comfort in the fact that doctors now have the tools to accurately diagnose rhinovirus infections, making us better apt to stave off these pesky microbes.</p>\r\n', 'Matt Stauffer and Ben Weight', 'Matt is a fifth year senior in materials science.

According to Schroedl, this project addressed pressing issues. “The world needs to change the ways it produces and consumes energy,” Schroedl says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn order to tackle these concerns with the moped design project, the class analyzed a variety of potential options. “The prospect of utilizing fuel cells and electric drive was mentioned. However, such a project would require a larger commitment of resources and time, and more extensive expertise than a group of freshmen engineering students could independently provide,” Schroedl says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat’s when the students decided to try electrolysis.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Electrolysis is the process of splitting water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, via electricity,” Schroedl says. In the end, this mechanism seemed to be the best option for the InterEGR 160 students. “The products of this reaction are fed into the scooter’s fuel system, replacing some of the gasoline-air mixture that is burned thus reducing the consumption of gasoline,” Schroedl says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe injection of hydrogen and oxygen enhances the combustion of gasoline in the engine, yielding a more efficient burning process and, ultimately, improving mileage on a per gallon basis. As a result, there are fewer emissions released from the vehicle, and fewer gasoline byproducts.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnderson’s class was partitioned into groups, each of which was responsible for a certain function of the electrolysis system. “In our lab, there were several subgroups that were assigned to various tasks. The two larger groups were the electrolyzer group and the delivery group,” Schroedl says. “The electrolyzer group was responsible for the characterization of electrode materials and for the design, construction and testing of the electrolyzer. The delivery group was responsible for the reconfiguration of the moped’s fuel system, the benchmarking of the scooter and for the evaluation of the effects of hydrogen on the scooter’s performance.” Other smaller groups helped with the presentation aspects of the project, including doing research, putting together the presentation and writing the project report.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/moped2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The hybrid Vespa’s internal combustion engine uses less gasoline than the original engine, creating a more eco-friendly model.</div>\r\n</div><p>\r\nThrough collaboration, the groups final design employs a series of electrodes in conjunction with a set of carbon plates that are lined with a thin film. The plates are fitted into the electrolyzer casing and aligned near the engine. The moped’s alternator provides energy to the electrodes that are used to separate the water into hydrogen and oxygen. Finally, the free hydrogen is channeled into the engine through stainless steel tubing. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter implementing the system, the students tested their work, and were pleasantly surprised by the results. “When tested on a dynamometer, the hydrogen-supplemented scooter consumed less gasoline than [the original] ... the fuel efficiency was increased by about 10 percent,” Schroedl says.\r\n</p><div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/moped3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Introduction to Engineering 160 students with their hydrogen Vespa scooter from left: Steve Burbach, Sean Kelly, and Carl Schroedl.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \r\nThe InterEGR 160 Vespa project offers just a glimpse of the possibilities offered by electrolysis. There is potential for this system to be implemented into other internal combustion engine (ICE)-based vehicles, as well as in applications that extend beyond this use. \r\n</p><p>\r\n“The ICE supplementation system could be scaled to larger vehicles. The gaseous byproducts of the electrolyzer can be utilized in fuel cells and in chemical industry,” Schroedl says. \r\n</p><p>\r\n“One can only speculate how the energy issue will play out in the coming years, but the InterEGR 160 Vespa project offers some hope for the limitless possibilities that lie before us,” Schroedl says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“I learned that with three and a half months, a small budget and excellent faculty guidance, a group of freshmen engineering students could rise to the challenge and accomplish something truly worthwhile,” Schroedl says.</p>\r\n', 'Anthony Lai', 'Anthony is a senior majoring in computer engineering and political science.

He and his team of graduate students are using novel techniques to quantify some of the dynamic processes involved in viral infections. \r\nBefore delving into the finer points of Yin’s research, let’s take a brief look at what actually happens to our cells when our body is infected by a virus.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/virus1.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Yin’s team uses a method called flow cytometry. A fluorescent marker  allows the team to identify cells that have been infected with the virus and quantify the rate of virus infection in the culture of cells.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \r\nA healthy tissue cell works tirelessly to take in nutrients and use its genetic material as a template to make proteins and enzymes, which will later be shipped out all over the body. Proteins and enzymes are the basis of the amazing harmony of chemical reactions that power life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEvery once in a while, however, a tiny virus particle floats by a cell and latches onto its membrane. This miniscule organism is one thousand times smaller than the cell, consisting of little more than a chromosome surrounded by a protective shell. Harmless as it seems, this little bugger has devious plans. \r\n</p><p>\r\nQuickly, the virus injects its chromosome into the cell. The virus DNA hijacks the cell’s DNA-reading system and runs its chromosome through it. Soon, the cell is no longer able to go about its usual business of churning out useful proteins because its machinery is being used by the virus DNA to manufacture the virus’s proteins and enzymes. Once created, these new virus proteins and enzymes form new shells around duplicate copies of the virus DNA, also made by the cell’s own DNA copy machine. Soon, there are so many viruses inside the cell that it bursts open, releasing the spawn to wreak havoc on the surrounding cells.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/virus2.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">This microscope used in professor Yin’s lab is encased to create a controlled environment by limiting the parameters that can affect the cell culture being studied.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nThis amazing cellular story has been elucidated by decades of research by various biologists, geneticists and biochemists. But the physical and chemical pathways that govern virus proliferation remain shrouded in complexity. These pathways involve large and elaborate molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and enzymes. Thus, the movements and reactions of these species are complex and difficult to unravel.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe main goal of Yin’s group is to gain a quantitative understanding of the timing of the overall processes. “By using the engineering tools, [chemical] kinetics and systems transport, we can begin to integrate the various components that come together and ultimately define the life cycle of the virus,” Yin says. To do this, Yin’s research team must measure virus reproduction rates under precise conditions. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe team uses a method called flow cytometry. A culture of cells is first infected with a small amount of viruses marked with a fluorescent dye. Before the viruses are allowed to grow, the cells are sent single file through a very small tube. A microscopic fluorescent camera will identify a cell with one fluorescent virus inside it, and a mechanism deflects the cell into a separate stream for collection. Rates of virus growth can then be precisely quantified. \r\n</p><p>\r\nParameters such as nutrient levels, pressure and presence of certain proteins are varied in order to experimentally determine the virus’s sensitivity to these factors. This method can help indicate which parts of the overall process require what amounts of certain resources. “Most biologists would agree, for example, that protein synthesis is very resource-intensive, but to be able to calculate it and say, ‘it’s using 80% of the resources’ ... then we are able to think of the big picture,” Yin says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nComputational models with the ability to predict sensitivity to particular conditions is very useful to researchers hoping to simulate effects of antibodies and drugs. “When you have a model that tells you how much virus is produced in how much time, you can then simulate effects of drugs,” Yin says. “If I inhibit one of these hundreds or thousands of reactions, how will the virus grow?” \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../sep09/virus3.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Collin Timm, a chemical and biological engineering graduate student in Professor Yin’s lab, grows cell cultures with biotic parameters that can be varied to study virus’s growth response.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nUnderstanding how the virus hijacks a cell’s DNA copy machine and protein assembly line has a broad range of applications. This includes not only creating better drugs to fight viruses but also the engineering of useful viruses for targeted drug delivery and gene therapy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nYin’s research also addresses the broader question of biology—that is, how do genes encode to create organisms? Every organism starts as a single cell with a particular genotype and then grows in its environment into an adult. The genotype and the environment determine an organism’s phenotype, or its collection of attributes. Virus DNA might contain 10,000 base pairs, compared to the human genome which has three billion. “We study the simplest genomes ... that might [only] encode five or ten proteins, but nevertheless there is an aspect of genome interacting with environment,” Yin says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn prior research, Yin has shown principles of natural selection and rapid evolution through virology. By artificially introducing a protein into a sample, Yin observed proliferation of viruses that simply no longer had the gene to produce that protein. The mutated viruses with the shortened chromosome were able to reproduce faster and out-compete viruses with the original larger chromosome.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe molecules an organism can produce define all its vital life systems and its characteristics. “We think that by devising experiments and models to create the link between genotype and environment and phenotype [we will be able] to predict characteristics of an organism,” Yin says.\r\n</p>', 'Neal O\\''Meara', 'Neal is a junior studying chemical engineering.

We are either told to calculate it by multiplying two numbers or to just completely neglect it in order to solve the problem. In real world applications, especially on the nanoscale, dealing with friction is not so plain and simple.</p>\r\n<p>In an article published in Nature in February 2009, two UW-Madison professors, Izabella Szlufarska and Kevin Turner, along with graduate student Yifei Mo, proposed their theory on the causes of friction and how to predict it on the nanoscale.\r\nSince nanotechnology is such a rapidly growing field, these researchers are looking for ways to predict friction in nanoscale devices in order to prevent destructive effects.</p> <div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../sep09/nanofriction1.jpg\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../sep09/nanofriction1_thumb.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" /></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Using computer simulations, the interactions between particle surfaces can be seen at the nanoscale.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“The ratio of surface [area] to volume [of nanoscale devices] becomes very large, and the surface forces become very important,” Szlufarska says. “What we see is that they become even stronger than regular forces like gravity, and the pieces begin to stick spontaneously to one another.” </p>\r\n<p>This “stickiness” of the individual parts causes damage to the nano-machines and greatly affects their performance. In order to tackle this problem, the UW-Madison team set out to investigate the fundamental causes of this familiar phenomenon.\r\nWhat the team soon learned was that their effort to improve nanoscale devices was becoming the road to a breakthrough discovery of the fundamental elements of the friction force. Discovering the ultimate causes of friction and consequently learning how to prevent it can mean that future devices have the potential to be truly frictionless and therefore extremely efficient. </p>\r\n <p>“The problem is people don’t understand where friction comes from,” Szlufarska says. The group zoomed in and proposed that the reason previous theories were not consistent with experimental data was because surfaces that were assumed to be smooth were actually rough on the nanoscale. Szlufarska explains that the problem with the previous theories about nanofriction, called continuum theories, was that they “assumed the contact was smooth because it’s smooth if you look close. You don’t have to treat the atoms explicitly, and that’s why they are ‘continuum’ theories. What actually happens is that you go to a nanometer regime, then you begin to see those atoms and they begin to play a role.” </p>\r\n<p>Essentially, previous theories did not zoom in far enough and take into account the interaction between surfaces of atoms. “You can think of [a surface] like a mountain range … when you put surfaces on each other and [slide them], the mountaintops will bang into each other. This is what’s causing friction,” Szlufarska says. This idea had been previously considered, but not on the scale of atoms themselves. Since friction involves the interaction of the surfaces of atoms, the concept is further complicated. “There are many complex phenomena that underlie friction. This can be related to bonding, chemistry changes or some plastic deformation that happens in the material,” Szlufarska says. “It is going to depend on the environment—whether you have humidity, what the temperature is and so on.”</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../sep09/nanofriction3.jpg\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../sep09/nanofriction3_thumb.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" /></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">A cluster of super fast processors are networked to carry out the massive calculations necessary to model atomic scale friction.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Another hump that the researchers had to overcome in addition to considering all of these details is the fact that nanoscale friction works differently than anything seen before. “It turns out that the laws of friction that work at the macroscale do not work at the nanoscale,” Szlufarska says.</p> \r\n<p>The professors have turned to computer simulation to help them learn about what was happening at the nanoscale. The magnitude of data involved in these simulations is tremendously large since nanoscale friction involves individual atoms. As such, this is not the type of computer problem that can be done on a standard desktop or laptop computer.</p> \r\n<p>The team uses what is called a high-performance computer plaster system. “Take the fastest processor you can, then take the fastest network you can, put it between processors and you design a software that works across all those computers,” Szlufarska says. This computer system is so powerful when modeling friction under specific conditions that, as student Yifei Mo says, “to obtain one such function we needed 20 days of computing on our high-performance computer cluster. The same calculations would take 46 years on a decent laptop.”</p>\r\n <p>“I think there’s this general [problem] that a lot of people have been doing many experiments [measuring friction] at the small scale, and the [computer] models haven’t necessarily kept up to this point. So there have been far more measurements and understanding of the measurements coming out now,” Turner says.</p> \r\nThe computer simulations allow researchers to observe aspects of nanofriction that could not be seen otherwise. “With these simulations, we can exactly track the movement of every atom; so it is basically in atomic-scale resolution, which is impossible in experiments,” Mo says.</p> \r\n<p>“But at the same time we try and compare [simulation results] to experiments because we want to make sure whatever we are predicting is something that is consistent with experiment and realistic,” Turner says.</p>\r\nIn addition to its impact on nanotechnology, the team’s findings have far-reaching implications for friction between all surfaces. “You really have to go down to this small level, look at this really simple asperity and try to understand friction there. Then you can take it back to the engineering surfaces,” Szlufarska says. The significance of being able to model friction is that scientists can then design for it in order to reduce it. “Friction is just tremendously important. You can think about it in terms of everything from car bearings to energy efficiency. If you can figure out new ways to reduce friction, you can have much more efficient power systems. I think there are big implications if you can understand how to manipulate it,” Turner says.</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../sep09/nanofriction5.jpg\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../sep09/nanofriction5_thumb.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" /></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Graduate student Yifei Mo, Professor Izabela Szlufarkska, and Professor Kevin Turner research nanoscale friction with the aid of powerful computer processors.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This work has opened the door to the possibility of truly frictionless devices.

The team, consisting of\r\ndistinguished research professor Kumar\r\nSridharah and Michael Corradini, as well as\r\nother UW-Madison faculty, graduate students\r\nand undergraduate students, conduct\r\ninnovative research investigating several\r\nhigh impact molten salt applications.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMolten salts encompass a wide variety of\r\nionic compounds, each with unique physical\r\nproperties such as melting point, high\r\nthermal conductivity, specific heat and density\r\nthat make each salt ideal for heat transfer\r\napplications.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to advantageous thermal properties,\r\nmost of these salts are resistant to\r\nthermal decomposition far beyond the\r\nlimits of conventional heat transfer fluids\r\nsuch as oil, which allows engineers to employ\r\nthese salts in applications that require\r\nextreme temperature environments for extended\r\nperiods of time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the most important facets of molten\r\nsalt research concerns the design of heat\r\ntransfer systems that can transfer process\r\nheat from next-generation, high-temperature\r\nnuclear reactors to hydrogen production\r\nplants or chemical industries. This\r\ncould have a significant impact on the economics\r\nof nuclear reactor systems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../nov09/IMG_0654.jpg\\" >\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">\r\nThis custom-fabricated valve regulates the freezing point\r\nof molten salts by purging or adding water as the sytem temperature\r\nfluctuates during heat transfer.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of the heat transfer capabilities,\r\nanother concept under development is the\r\nuse of molten salts as a coolant in nuclear\r\nreactors, where they would transfer heat\r\nfrom nuclear fission to steam or gas turbine\r\ngenerators. Additionally, the heat generated\r\nby fission may also be used to directly power other \r\nchemical processing satellite facilities,\r\nconserving energy by cutting out the need to\r\ngenerate electricity or burn fossil fuels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the newest aspect of research, spent\r\nnuclear fuel is dissolved in molten salt to\r\nfacilitate electrochemical separation of nuclear\r\nwaste claddings from the unspent fuel.\r\nThough the technology dates back a few decades\r\nto studies at Argonne and Idaho National\r\nLaboratories, the field is still rife with\r\nopportunity because it is an important step\r\ntowards fuel recycling, and it minimizes the\r\nneed for nuclear waste storage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“In the Department of Energy community\r\nthis has become a big issue. Now that the\r\nYucca [Mountain] is on hold, we can’t say\r\nwe are going to send everything there,”\r\nSridharan says. “So waste separation—taking\r\nthe fuel and trying to separate the good\r\nand the bad—has become a big issue.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe salts are also applicable in a variety of\r\nsolar thermal energy systems. “They are a\r\ngood heat storage medium, kind of like a\r\nbattery,” Anderson says. “It is relatively easy\r\nto store a large amount of energy in a big\r\npool of liquid salt.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nResearchers are developing salt mixtures\r\nwith low freezing temperatures for implementation\r\nin two main types of solar thermal\r\nsystems: power towers and parabolic\r\ntroughs. In a power tower, a field of mirrors\r\nfocuses light onto a single tower, which is\r\nfilled with a heat transfer fluid. In contrast, a\r\nparabolic trough system is composed of crescent-\r\nshaped mirrors that focus light on tubes\r\npumping this heat transfer fluid. The fluid in\r\neither system can directly power facilities,\r\neliminating energy loss that normally occurs\r\nwhen solar energy is converted to electricity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPower tower systems are easier to engineer\r\nbecause the tower holding the molten salt\r\ncan be drained at night to prevent freezing.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../nov09/IMG_0632e2.jpg\\" target=\\"\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/IMG_0632e.jpg\\" ></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">\r\nThe immense potential of molten salts drives this research team to investigate the \r\npotentials in heat transfer, fuel recycling, and solar thermal systems.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nConversely, salt’s applicability in parabolic\r\ntroughs is limited because the salt is dispersed\r\nthroughout the field of troughs, increasing\r\nthe risk that it might freeze at night\r\nthen rupture the pipes when the salt melts\r\nand expands in the heat of the next day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, conventional parabolic trough\r\nsystems could be modified to accommodate\r\nthis issue. The addition of a water evaporation\r\nsystem, for instance, could dilute\r\nthe molten salt to prevent freezing as the\r\nsystem cools, then evaporate off to allow\r\nfull temperature operation. This modified\r\nsystem would have a much lower freezing\r\npoint while retaining all the beneficial\r\nphysical properties of pure molten salt at\r\nhigh temperatures.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nResearchers have fabricated such a modified\r\nflow system to study the effects of adding\r\nwater to molten salts. Anderson describes\r\nthe complete startup and shutdown of a flow\r\nloop integrating the molten salt and water\r\nsystem as one of the most exciting moments\r\nin his recent lab work with the salts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the experiment, water is quickly\r\nboiled out of solution as the system approaches\r\nits operational temperature of approximately\r\n500 C, producing a pure molten\r\nliquid salt. During shutdown, the water is\r\nreintroduced as the system to prevent freezing\r\nas the system cools.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMuch to the surprise of Anderson and others,\r\nthe water did not flash vaporize or have\r\nany other negative reactions when injected\r\nat 200 C, proving that this approach can be\r\nutilized to safely reduce the freezing point of\r\nlarger molten salt systems. There are, however,\r\nstill issues with the system that need to\r\nbe developed and researched.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThough each of the different applications of\r\nmolten salt is important in its own right, a\r\ncrucial area of research pertinent in all applications\r\nconcerns, not the salt itself, but\r\nrather the materials that contain it. Sridharan\r\nleads the team in materials corrosion\r\nresearch, which studies how conventional\r\nalloys, ceramics and coatings hold up under\r\nextreme chemical environments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“One of the thrusts of the program is to\r\nlook at materials that can withstand corrosion\r\nin high temperature salts to understand\r\nhow corrosion occurs in static and flowing\r\nsalt environments, and which materials and\r\ncoatings can be applied to mitigate the effects\r\nof corrosion,” Sridharan says. Nanomaterial\r\ncoatings present a highly applicable\r\narea of research for enhancing corrosion\r\nresistance. “I can see nanomaterial coating\r\nbecoming an area of fundamental research\r\ncoming up in the next year or so.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a solid foundation in proven technologies\r\nand a dedicated team brimming with\r\nnew ideas and expertise, molten salt research\r\nat UW-Madison could move in many\r\ndirections. “We are looking now at coupling\r\nsuper critical CO2 cycles with liquid salt heat\r\ntransfer and storage technologies,” Sridharan\r\nsays.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhether the application is in solar, biomass\r\nor nuclear applications, molten salts as a\r\nthermal storage medium can play a vital role\r\nin increasing the efficiency of our current\r\nenergy infrastructure and economizing sustainable\r\nforms of energy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo the next time there is a heated discussion\r\nconcerning nuclear or renewable energy,\r\nremember that the secret ingredient is just\r\npinch of salt.\r\n</p>', 'Timothy Busse', 'Tim Busse is a senior majoring\r\nin chemical engineering with a certificate\r\nin technical communication.

The caption: “My first walleye!”\r\nIt’s a cherished experience, but one that\r\nis facing a serious threat in the depths of many\r\nWisconsin lakes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe threat is Osmerus mordax, commonly\r\nknown as the rainbow smelt. This species of\r\nfish is native to the Atlantic coast from New\r\nJersey to southern Canada, and it has taken a\r\nliking to inland Wisconsin lakes.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>“Smelt are a death sentence...If\r\nthey get into a lake the walleye\r\nare gone in ten or fifteen years”\r\n</p>\r\n-Dr. Stephpen Carpenter</h3>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe rainbow smelt’s journey from the ocean\r\nto our lakes was a long one. Rainbow smelt\r\nwere once exclusive to salt water, entering\r\nfresh water only in the early spring to spawn.\r\nThe species was introduced into the freshwater\r\nlakes of Michigan in 1912 to serve as food\r\nfor commercially stocked populations of Atlantic\r\nsalmon. The smelt thrived in their new\r\nfreshwater habitat, and the population quickly\r\nspread to Lake Michigan. In 1928, the first O.\r\nmordax were detected in Wisconsin waters at\r\nLittle Sturgeon Bay in Door County. Through\r\nthe efforts of individual fishermen, smelt were\r\ntransported to the inland lakes of Wisconsin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough its physical appearance is less than\r\nmenacing, the species brings on terrible ecological\r\neffects on the native aquatic species.\r\nSmelt feed on the juveniles of many different\r\nnative species, particularly walleye and yellow\r\nperch. Smelt also consume zooplankton, the\r\nmain diet of newly hatched walleye and perch.\r\nAdditionally, the smelt are rich in enzymes\r\nthat destroy thiamine, a vitamin necessary for the development of fish embryos and one\r\nthat can cause harm to the reproduction of the\r\ngame fish that eat them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“Smelt are a death sentence,” Dr. Stephen\r\nCarpenter, an award-winning ecologist\r\nand professor of zoology at UW-Madison,\r\nsays. “If they get into a lake, the walleye\r\nare gone in ten or fifteen years.” The damage\r\nthat the nonnative smelt population is\r\ncausing to Wisconsin ecosystems has been\r\nwell documented by the Department of\r\nNatural Resources, but current measures\r\nonly prevent the spread of smelt. Considered\r\na ‘rough fish,’ transportation of live\r\nsmelt away from the body of water in which\r\nit was caught is illegal. However, many anglers\r\nare unaware or neglectful of these\r\nlaws and continue to use the smelt as bait\r\nfor game fish. Fifteen lakes in Vilas County,\r\nWisconsin are now populated with\r\nsmelt, and six of those lakes have already\r\nlost their reproducing walleye population.\r\nUntil recently, it was thought impossible\r\nto remove the invasive population without\r\nfurther damaging the native species. However,\r\na team of UW-Madison engineers and\r\nlimnologists led by Dr. Carpenter and Dr.\r\nChin Wu, a professor of civil and environmental\r\nengineering, are tackling the smelt\r\ninfestation with some revolutionary ideas.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../nov09/smelt.jpg\\" >\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The rainbow smelt doesn\\''t appear menacing, but they are a devastating invasive aquatic species responsible for damaging walleye populations across the state.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“Smelt are highly adapted to cold water that is\r\nrich in oxygen. Our goal is to eliminate that\r\nkind of water from the lake,” Carpenter says.\r\nThis is certainly not a light undertaking, but\r\nthe team is confident in its new solution, which\r\nis a device known as GELI (Gradual Entrainment\r\nLake Inverter).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“[The device] looks like a kiddy swimming\r\npool, but much, much bigger,” Carpenter says.\r\n“It is four to five meters in radius. A giant disk\r\nwith a reinforced rim sinks into the lake. You\r\ninflate the rim and it rises carrying the cold\r\nwater. You spill the cold water and pump the\r\nair out.” This process mixes the warm water at\r\nthe surface with the colder water in the depths,\r\neffectively raising the temperature of the smelt\r\nhabitat. The increase of temperature will either\r\nkill the fish or stress its breeding habits, thus\r\npreventing it from reproducing. The native species,\r\nsuch as walleye, live at temperatures much\r\nhigher than the projected final temperature, after\r\nusing the GELI.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“We’re looking at increasing the temperature\r\nto around 20 degrees Centigrade. The native\r\nspecies involved live in lakes around and above\r\n25 degrees, so there is no danger of harming\r\nthem,” Jordan Read, a doctoral candidate in\r\ncivil and environmental engineering, says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe GELI is still a work in progress, and several\r\nquestions need to be answered. “How many GELI\r\ndo we need? Do we bunch them up in the middle\r\nor spread them around? Do we use them as soon\r\nas the ice melts or later?” Carpenter says, but he remains\r\nconfident these questions will be answered.\r\n“So far everything looks really good. We’re going\r\nto test, test and retest. Just like any other large\r\nintervention, we’re going to be very careful, but\r\nthere has been no indication we shouldn’t be moving\r\nforward with this technology.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“This isn’t going to be a panacea. You need a\r\ncold-water species you want to kill, while none\r\nof the other species are sensitive to removal,”\r\nCarpenter says. The teams plan is to move the\r\nproject to a large scale, hopefully using it in\r\nseveral smelt-ridden lakes, but Carpenter and\r\nhis team understand the limits of the GELI.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe team has done preliminary field tests in\r\ncentral and northern Wisconsin lakes, including\r\nCrystal Lake in Vilas County, which no\r\nlonger has a yellow perch population due to the\r\nsmelt invaders. This 83 acre lake is expected\r\nto be one of the first to receive extensive GELI\r\ntreatment. Additionally, Read sees potential in\r\nusing this technology in areas suffering oxygen\r\ndepletion or in drinking water reservoirs. Currently\r\nreservoirs are treated by pressurized aeration,\r\nbut tests have shown that the GELI technology\r\ncan be up to ten times more efficient.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../nov09/Geli.jpg\\" >\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The GELI creates a column of warm water, raising temperatures to levels uninhabitable by invasive smelt.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nRead says the team\r\nis using this year as a\r\nbaseline year to gather\r\ninformation about the\r\nfish populations, while\r\nthe GELI is projected to\r\nbe introduced to lakes\r\nin 2011 or 2012. As the\r\nteam diligently moves\r\nforward, the future of\r\nWisconsin’s lakes and\r\nfisheries look to be in\r\ngood hands, and the\r\nnext generations of anglers should have no\r\ntrouble finding their first walleye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Jack Johnson', 'Jack Johnson is a freshman in the\r\ncollege of engineering at UW-Madison.

The worst part is that when, or\r\nif, you do got to bed, you’ll have to arise in just a\r\nfew hours, to do it all over again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStudents from every corner of campus are all-too\r\nfamiliar with this scenario. For most, the school\r\nweek means five days of nonstop classes, meetings,\r\nwork and studying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe typical college student doesn’t acknowledge\r\nthe effects of stress beyond a sense of panic and\r\nanxiety, but in reality, stress has distinct effects\r\non the brain. It can be caused by one’s environment,\r\none’s body and even one’s thoughts. However,\r\nstress can be managed and greatly reduced\r\nwith the use of simple tips and techniques.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile many of us wish there were six extra hours\r\nin our day, it is unfortunately out of the question.\r\nOne of the hardest things about being a college\r\nstudent is managing countless hours of studying,\r\nclass, projects and jobs. Factor in the typical\r\nSaturday of tailgating and football, and the\r\nresult is an equation for maximum stress. For a\r\ncollege student, stress is just one more book on\r\nan already daunting stack of homework. This is\r\nwhy it is important to manage stress and keep it\r\nfrom adding to the chaos.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>“I feel very overwhelmed,\r\nexhausted, like I can’t fit\r\neverything into the day.”\r\n-Caitlin DeVos</h3><hr>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStress has many causes and it affects each person\r\ndifferently. However, there is no denying\r\nthat it spreads to every corner of campus, from\r\nthe freshmen in the dorms experiencing life\r\non their own for the first time, to the graduate\r\nstudents performing breakthrough research.\r\nWhatever the case, college students must deal\r\nwith many unique conditions that seem to promote\r\nstressful situations.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“I feel very overwhelmed, exhausted, like I can’t\r\nfit everything into the day,” Caitlin DeVos, a\r\nfreshman at UW-Madison who is dealing with\r\nthe stress of being new to an enormous college\r\ncampus, says. DeVos explains that the stress of\r\nbeing a freshman includes things like “coming to\r\na new place, living with people you don’t know\r\nand trying to get along with them.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDeVos is not alone. Freshmen year is a stressful\r\ntime for most students, as they adapt to an\r\nunfamiliar environment while forming new\r\nrelationships away from home. According to a\r\nstudy done in College Student Journal, “College\r\nstudents, especially freshmen, are a group particularly\r\nprone to stress.” A study done by the\r\nCollege Chronic Life Stress Survey found that\r\n“in regard to chronic stress, first-year students\r\nscored higher than other students.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeing in a new environment is not the only\r\nthing that freshmen have to deal with. In addition\r\nto new surroundings and a roommate she\r\nhas never met, DeVos and other freshmen must\r\ndeal with strenuous coursework. “My classes are\r\nvery stressful; I am taking 15 credits including\r\nchemistry, which is not very fun,” DeVos says.\r\nIt’s no secret that adapting to new types of classes,\r\nwhich are often filled with 300 students, is an\r\nadded stress for freshmen. In fact, research has\r\nshown that freshmen and sophomores in college\r\nreact more to stress than juniors and seniors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo that means all juniors and seniors in college\r\nare completely stress-free, right? “I try not to\r\nlet [stress] affect me too much, but because I’m\r\nso concerned with grades it obviously does,”\r\nBrandon Deaner, a junior majoring in Engineering\r\nMechanics with plenty on his to-do\r\nlist every week, says.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../nov09/poll.jpg\\" target=\\"\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/poll1.jpg\\" ></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">\r\nA poll conducted by the magazine of 100 students about how they manage stress. Students\r\nwere asked to check all those that apply. Listening to music, spending time with friends\r\nand family, and watching tv or movies ranked among the top choices.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nDeaner has been managing a jam-packed schedule\r\nsince he began college. Since his first semester,\r\nDeaner has been involved in time-consuming\r\nextra-curricular activities creating obligations\r\nin addition to courses work. He participates in\r\nstudent organizations related to his major, the\r\nrunning club and works a part-time job. It goes\r\nwithout saying that this is all in addition to a demanding\r\ncourse-load. Last semester he clocked\r\nhow much time he spent studying and found that\r\nhe was spending a daunting thirty-seven hours a\r\nweek on homework alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe desire to achieve academic success and\r\nmaintain a busy schedule to bolster a resume is\r\none thing that drives college students. This also\r\ncauses a great deal of pressure and anxiety. Many\r\npeople can relate to cramming at the library until\r\nthe early morning hours, depriving their bodies\r\nof sleep and sanity, just to excel in a particular\r\nclass. Filling the days with activity after activity\r\nleaves little time for the body to relax and decompress.\r\nMany may feel it is necessary to get the\r\nmost out of the day and to not waste any time,\r\nbut students must remember that it is important\r\nto slow down and relax every once in awhile. It is\r\nbest to give the brain a break to let it recuperate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNot all stress can be blamed on new environments\r\nand heavy coursework; most students actually\r\nperpetuate stress with a little thing called\r\nprocrastination. According to Piers Steel, of the\r\nUniversity of Calgary, students will “delay tasks\r\nthey are not confident about,” especially if “the\r\ntask is [less] urgent, less appealing, or daunting.”\r\nIn the end, the postponement of tasks will only\r\ncause more stress, making procrastination a double\r\nthreat. This phenomenon is all too familiar to\r\nBill Neave, a junior at UW-Madison. When asked\r\nwhy he procrastinates, Neave says “I know that\r\nonce I start to do the work, the reality of all the\r\nwork I have to do will hit me.” As expected, procrastination\r\nis hard to avoid, even though Neave\r\nacknowledges the importance of managing stress\r\n“because quality of work or health can suffer.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile many people think stress is just an inevitable\r\npart of life, there is much more to it. The\r\nstresses felt throughout the day have effects on\r\nthe brain, but not all of them are adverse. Naturally,\r\none might think that the body’s physical\r\nand emotional reactions to stress cause reactions\r\nin the brain, but it is actually the other way\r\naround. Chemicals released in the brain are compounded\r\nby stress, and these reactions then trigger\r\nthe physical and emotional response. Often\r\ntimes these physical and emotional responses are\r\nnot managed by the person feeling them, or are\r\nignored altogether.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is clear that college life is stressful, but the real\r\nquestion is, do students know how to relieve and\r\ncope with it? “I stay up late to get things done,”\r\nDeVos, the college freshman, says. She also responds\r\nto stress by relaxing and socializing,\r\nand does her best to “take naps and have fun to\r\nrelieve stress from the week.” Despite his overloaded\r\nschedule, Deane is able to manage stress by staying active. “A half-hour run can do a world of good for me,” Deane says. And Neave, the student\r\nwho admits to procrastinating occasionally,\r\nconfronts his stress by “planning, exercising and\r\ndoing fun things.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Rob Sepich, a stress management\r\ncounselor at University Health Services, relieving\r\nstress can be as simple as adjusting “the perspective\r\nyou take about it, more than the external\r\nstresses … Taking lots of brief breaks helps a lot,\r\nnot just the weekend, or at end of the semester,”\r\nSepich says. He also advises students to “find\r\nplaces on campus where you’re not studying, just\r\nto relax.” He notes that it’s important for students\r\nto associate campus and surrounding areas with\r\nmore than just the stresses of academics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“An anxious mind can’t exist in a relaxed\r\nbody,” Sepich says, highlighting the undeniable\r\nlink between mental and physical stress. “Posture\r\nis important; having relaxed shoulders and\r\nslow breathing will have mental effects.” Speich\r\nalso suggests that students exercise for a half an\r\nhour each day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it comes to the stress of being new to a college\r\ncampus, Sepich has plenty of helpful strategies.\r\n“Maintaining contacts and support from\r\nhome is important,” Sepich says. “Those old relationships\r\nare not over, they’re just different.” He\r\nalso suggests getting involved in an organization\r\nthat is similar to something you had been involved\r\nwith previously, as well as getting involved\r\nwith something new that interests you. This will\r\nhelp make the transition easier, all while making\r\nthe college experience “your own.” Last, but not\r\nleast, “acknowledge that change is hard and that\r\nmany are feeling the exact same way,” Sepich says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy following these simple tips one can manage\r\nand learn to cope with stress, minimize hair\r\npulling and maximize productivity. With these\r\ntips, Monday may not seem as agonizing and the\r\ntemptation to slap the snooze alarm may subside.\r\nWith a little luck, one might even be able to add a\r\nfew extra hours to the day.\r\n</p>', 'Marcus Hawkins and Lauren Kern', 'Marcus is a junior majoring in nuclear\r\nengineering.

('nov09eCow', 'Mooving from eCOW to eCOW2', 'article', 'The college of Engineering makes the official switch to a feature-rich Learning Management Software', 'November', 2009, '<p>\r\nStudents and professors in the college of engineering\r\nhave a powerful new learning tool\r\nat their disposal, and with the help of fellow\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students, they can\r\nlearn to use this tool to its full potential.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor almost 15 years, college of engineering students\r\nand professors have depended on Engineering\r\nCourses on the Web (eCOW) to share\r\nand view course materials over the Internet. This\r\npast summer, eCOW was shut down and the official\r\nswitch to eCOW2 was made.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe learning management system (LMS) eCOW\r\nwas a software designed to support learning\r\nthrough technology. It provided a space for professors\r\nto upload files and an easy-to-use interface\r\nfor students to access them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, eCOW1 was a fantastic product, and\r\nactually still is in terms of its simplicity and\r\ninterface … but it was also built in the midto\r\nlate-90’s by an employee who is no longer\r\nhere, with a technology that’s kind of getting\r\nold and we needed to update it.” Paul Oliphant,\r\ncomputer-aided engineering (CAE) consultant\r\nfor the Technology-Enhanced Learning\r\n(TEL) project, says. CAE spent years just\r\ntrying to figure out what to do with eCOW\r\nand eventually agreed that maintaining it just\r\nwasn’t feasible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAround the same time, UW-Madison purchased\r\nthe Desire2Learn (D2L) license and\r\nused it to craft a campus-wide online LMS\r\nknown as Learn@UW. Unfortunately, usage\r\nof Learn@UW didn’t skyrocket in the college\r\nof engineering and eCOW retained market\r\nshare. “What it really boils down to is that we\r\nfound that the D2L product wasn’t really effective\r\nfor foreign languages. And engineers\r\ntalk a foreign language. It’s called mathematics,”\r\nOliphant says. Thus, the search began for\r\na new LMS that could fulfill the special needs\r\nof engineers.\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<img src=\\"../nov09/ecowa.JPG\\" >\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Clockwise from pi radians: Carrie Boecher, Evan Western, Natnan Miller, Andres Perdomo, Tim Tynan, Annete Spyker, David Simkins were instrumental in identifying the original eCOW’s shortcomings and implementing the changes seen in eCOW2.</div></div>\r\n<p>\r\n“[We] found that Moodle is the lead in the\r\nopen-source area for learning management\r\nsystems. It’s the front-runner all over the\r\nworld. Lots of people use it,” Oliphant says. In\r\nfact, as of the writing of this article, over 26\r\nmillion people from 204 countries are Moodle\r\nusers. Thus Moodle became the backbone of\r\neCOW2, but the college of engineering still\r\nneeded a team to support this new technology.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRepresentatives from CAE, including Oliphant,\r\njoined forces with Dr. Sandy Courter,\r\ndirector of the Engineering Learning Center\r\n(ELC) , in hiring a team to explore eCOW2,\r\nand work with instructors to produce a set of\r\nexample online course homepages. The typical\r\nroute would have been to hire instructional\r\ndesigners who also had a focus on technology.\r\nInstead, they made the unprecedented decision\r\nto hire a team of motivated and computersavvy\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students to\r\ntake on this role.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n“I think that this model of the undergraduate\r\nTEL consultants working with the graduate\r\nstudents is an awesome way to get undergraduates\r\ninvolved in the process of improving the\r\nway we are learning in our college of engineering,”\r\nCourter says. “The faculty are learning in\r\nthe process and the undergrads are learning,\r\nbut they’re also helping instructors teach better.\r\nI think that has been a missing link for a\r\nwhile, and it’s just the beginning.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFunded through the offices of Aaron Brower,\r\nvice provost for teaching and learning, and\r\nSteve Cramer, associate dean for academic\r\naffairs, this team of students was tasked with\r\nintegrating eCOW2 into courses in the college\r\nof engineering, providing support to faculty\r\nin their transition to eCOW2 and producing\r\nlong-term instructional materials for its use.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery week throughout the summer, these\r\nstudents held three-hour team meetings with\r\nCourter, Oliphant and other CAE consultants\r\nto share new things they discovered in Moo-\r\nBy Dylan Liebl\r\nGENERAL\r\ndle, problems they encountered and to discuss\r\nplans for the upcoming week. While the meetings\r\nhave been cut down due to class schedules,\r\nthe students continue to flood the meeting\r\nroom with knowledge of the college of engineering’s\r\nnew LMS. “There’s a reason I’ve been\r\ncoming to the meetings. It’s not just to contribute,\r\nit’s to learn,” Oliphant says.\r\n</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<img src=\\"../nov09/ecowb.JPG\\" >\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">eCOW2 allows for users to personalize their home page and allows students to communicate instantly with other students or professors.</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, even with a support team at their\r\ndisposal, many college of engineering professors\r\nhave yet to integrate eCOW2 into their\r\ncourses. “The major challenge was helping the\r\nfaculty to make the change. There weren’t any\r\nchoices. The old eCOW was going away. And we\r\nbelieved, and still believe, that the new system is\r\nbetter, but it is difficult to change,” Courter says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe main advantage of eCOW2 is that it’s\r\nbased on open-source software. “One of the\r\nreasons that we went to open-source and\r\nnot a commercial product is that engineers\r\nare not necessarily mainstream. Many of\r\nthe learning systems that are out there are\r\ntailored to the mainstream because that is\r\nwhere the cash flow is, but engineers are a\r\nlittle more special, with the mathematics especially,”\r\nOliphant says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBecause Moodle is open-source, CAE developers\r\nare able to tweak eCOW2 specifically to\r\nengineers by integrating new features like the\r\nMathML Editor, which allows professors and\r\nstudents to type complex mathematical expressions\r\ninto any text box equipped with an HTML\r\neditor. The expressions appear just as they\r\nwould if someone had written them by hand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe new eCOW2 provides an abundance of features\r\nthat can reduce the workload for professors\r\nand enhance the learning experience for\r\nstudents. The different interactive activities allow\r\nprofessors to provide students with engaging\r\nmaterial at a more frequent rate than they\r\ncould ever achieve in class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAutomatically graded activities like quizzes\r\nand lessons free professors from the hours it\r\ntakes to grade them by hand, while at the same\r\ntime provides students with instant feedback.\r\nIn addition, a feature called the “feedback manager”\r\ncuts down on the time needed to grade\r\nanswers to essay questions for large classes.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr><h3>“The faculty are learning in the\r\nprocess and the undergrads\r\nare learning, but they’re also\r\nhelping instructors teach better.\r\nI think that has been a missing\r\nlink for a while, and it’s just the\r\nbeginning.”\r\n<br><br>-Professor Sandy Courter</h3><hr>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nECOW2 provides an organized structure for\r\nprofessors to store and display material, and for\r\nstudents to view and interact with that material.\r\nAs Courter says, “It’s a one-stop-shop. It’s\r\nreally handy to have all of your resources in one\r\nplace.” Once all of those resources are on an\r\neCOW2 page, the “label” resource can be used\r\nto display text, images and videos directly onto\r\na course’s page, giving it a personalized feel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps one of the greatest advantages that\r\nMoodle has over other LMSs is its emphasis\r\non collaborative “Web 2.0” activities, which\r\nhelp enforce group-based learning. Forums,\r\nwikis and chats allow students to work together\r\nto solve complex problems or document\r\nprojects.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne common use of the “chat” activity has\r\nbeen to replace scheduled office hours. Instead,\r\nprofessors can set up a chat room for a specific\r\ntime where students can ask questions and\r\nreceive answers from the professor, as well as\r\nother students, in real time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course with all these advantages there\r\nmust be some drawbacks. Since the technology\r\nis relatively new, bugs continue to be discovered\r\nby the support team, professors and\r\nstudents. So far, CAE developers have been\r\nable to squash the bugs or find temporary\r\nways to work around them while a permanent\r\nsolution is researched.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, eCOW2 is feature-rich, it demands\r\na more complicated interface than eCOW did.\r\nThis fact has been a turn-off for many professors.\r\nSome professors continue to demand the\r\nsame functionality of eCOW, “[but] can you\r\nimagine a Moodle site that is used in the exact\r\nsame way as the old eCOW? You can, but you\r\ndon’t want to. It’s like moving into a modern\r\nhouse and still having an outhouse out in the\r\nback and hauling in water every day to your\r\nsink,” Oliphant says.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe official switch to eCOW2 has been made,\r\nand in the process a model for linking undergraduates\r\nto professors has been created. There\r\nis still work to be done and the TEL support\r\nteam is hard at work creating long-term instructional\r\nmaterials and supporting professors\r\nin their transition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnly time can tell how eCOW2 will become\r\na foundation of engineering courses at UWMadison.\r\nBut if the hundreds of course home\r\npages already created are any indication,\r\neCOW2 is here to stay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWant to learn more about ECOW2?

No, it was because the Twins were playing their last-ever game in the Metrodome, their home field of the past 27 years. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNow, if you know anything about the Metrodome, you\\''re probably wondering how anyone could miss that ugly dump of a stadium.

I spent the better part of my life watching baseball in that stadium, observing the intricacies of the game, bonding with my dad and learning the facts of life from the drunken college kids who sat behind us in the left field bleachers. Dreadful as it was, the Metrodome was our stadium, and above all we felt comfortable there.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOf course I\\''m being ridiculous. Saying goodbye to the Metrodome is not a tragedy. In fact, as I write, the Metrodome\\''s replacement, Target Field, is sitting proudly in downtown Minneapolis, receiving its final construction touches and awaiting a sea of Twins fans. There are wood-backed seats, a heated open-air concourse and-get this-real grass!  It\\''s something many Minnesotans, myself included, have dreamed of for years. Still, I don\\''t know if I will ever feel as comfortable there as I did in the Metrodome.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOh, comfort. That warm, wonderful feeling that influences more of our decisions than we\\''d like to admit. Refusing to get out of a toasty bed on a snowy day, standing outside a banquet hall full of unknown faces, staying in the hometown we know rather than seeing what else the world has to offer-we\\''ve all chosen comfort over challenge at some point.

Even the majority of parts found in a Chevrolet-an American icon-are made in Canada, Mexico and China. This expanding marketplace doesn\\''t just apply to products; the job market, too, is now more international than ever before. As our country becomes more international and technology shrinks the globe, graduates are competing with international candidates to find jobs after college. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis competition has driven students to become more internationally savvy by learning languages and experiencing other cultures. When UW-Madison students want to gain experience overseas, they can turn to the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience, commonly known as IAESTE. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIAESTE is a cross-country internship exchange program for university students. The program provides UW-Madison students and students across the globe with the opportunity to gain experience through internships in industry and universities in a foreign country. IAESTE is very much an exchange system, with students from across the world essentially swapping jobs for awhile.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo how do students find these jobs? The local UW-Madison IAESTE chapter works to create jobs here in Madison, while other chapters do the same in their own cities. Chapters from the United States then report the jobs they find to the national IAESTE headquarters, whose members then attend an international meeting with the 80 or more other IAESTE chapters. After this exchange, the national committee places IAESTE members from the UW-Madison chapter with jobs that meet their requirements. Once members are placed in a job, final screening is completed by the new employer, and the member prepares to go overseas.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJon Jaeger, president of the UW-Madison chapter, says not only do IAESTE chapters set up internships, but the chapters also \\"take care of [the exchange students] in a way, setting up [their] housing and showing them the lay of the land,\\" in their new job and country.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA new requirement from the national IAESTE headquarters is that all students participating in the program must raise a job to be traded at the international meeting to take part[EB1]. Students who participate in the IAESTE internships must also be juniors or older, but sophomores are strongly encouraged to apply for the program for the following summer. This way, they have time to start looking for jobs so they may have one to exchange. Jaeger says, \\"[Getting an internship overseas] depends heavily on the individual, as we ask them to do a large part of the job raising, and it is vital to getting opportunities for our members.\\" \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<a href=\\"../nov09/iaeste_full.jpg\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/NOV09iaeste2web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" /></a>\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">UW-Madison students Greg Bartels (far left) and fellow interns explore the Czech Republic while interning abroad</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe job a student receives through IAESTE depends much on his or her set of technical skills. Specific engineer-oriented skills, such as experience in laboratories, data collection or computer programming can highly influence the type of job that an IAESTE member will obtain. Having an internship in the United States before taking one internationally with IAESTE is certainly an advantage. Honing these technical skills in the United States can help members enjoy their experiences that much more and often makes their time abroad much easier. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRegardless of these suggestions, the members of IAESTE welcome all students to join the organization, and their number one priority is to find an internship for anyone who would like one. IAESTE members are given the opportunity to experience a new country and encounter challenges very unique to an international internship. Whether it\\''s trying to perform computer programming with a German keyboard or tackling engineering problems unique to the region of the world, engineers abroad get a fresh perspective on the traditional internship experience. These challenges can broaden their critical thinking skills and make them better problem solvers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe IAESTE experience can help form the well-rounded individual employers in the United States and around the world are looking for: someone who can succeed outside of his or her comfort zone, solve complex problems and understand international issues. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you are interested in IAESTE go to <a href=\\"http://www.engr.wisc.edu/studentorgs/iaeste/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">www.engr.wisc.edu/studentorgs/iaeste/</a> or attend one of their meetings, which take place most Mondays at 8:00 pm in the Tong Auditorium in the Engineering Centers Building.</p>\r\n', 'John Keehn', 'John is a freshman in mechanical engineering.

Now, that list is much longer, and growing by the day.  In fact, it seems like we have to worry about almost everything: cell phones that rot our brains, plastic water bottles that leach carcinogens and fishing.  Yes, fishing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/NOV09lure2web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Ben Hobbins implemented skin grafting principles from his previous experience in the biotechnology industry to create the IronClad plastic soft lure</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, most people wouldn\\''t consider sport fishing an environmentally harmful activity. Sitting in a boat amidst a forested landscape and floating above a lake teeming with life doesn\\''t exactly seem hazardous. However, fishing may be more dangerous to the ecosystem than one might think, all because of a small, often-overlooked piece of the experience: the fishing lure.\r\n</p><p>The spectrum of fishing lures available is wide, from jigs to surface lures, spinnerbait to swimbait. These lures are designed primarily with form and function in mind. Plastic lures are especially favored for their ability to mimic the form, texture and movement of aquatic prey. In addition, these lures are easy to produce and affordable. These plastic lures are efficient and economical, however, they also taking a toll on our rivers and lakes. \r\n</p><p>To create a typical plastic lure, manufacturers often dope polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with phthalates, which are chemical compounds that serve to enhance the flexibility, transparency, and durability of the lure. \\"Half the weight of these lures is plasticizer, or very-low molecular-weight materials that are called phthalates,\\" Tim Osswald, director of the Polymer Engineering Center at the UW-Madison, says.\r\n</p><p>Unfortunately, these phthalates have been shown to pose significant health risks to humans and wildlife alike. If fact, they are prohibited for use in many products in different states. Therefore, it is particularly disturbing, according to Ben Hobbin, CEO and president of the Lake Resources Group based in Waunakee, that several thousand tons of plastic soft lure are deposited on the bottom of lakes, rivers, and other waterways each year, threatening the surrounding fauna and flora. \\"If you go into a sporting-goods store, every soft-plastic fishing lure on the wall is lost in the environment and that\\''s a staggering thought,\\" Hobbins says. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/NOV09lure4web.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The fibers of these IronClad lures are designed for superior strength and flexibility</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>How does this happen?\r\nAs it turns out, these traditional lures have a tendency to detach from the hooks on which they are set because they lack strain endurance. This means the lures stand a good chance of breaking off while meandering around thickets of local flora, or simply sliding off the hook at other inopportune times. The affordability and accessibility of these lures, coupled with their inclination to be lost, implies that the number of plastic lures stuck in sediment beds will only increase as time goes on. \r\n</p><p>That\\''s where Hobbins comes in. Looking for an alternative to the traditional lure, Hobbins, who is also an entrepreneur, went to the Wisconsin school of business and college of engineering for assistance. His goal was to develop a soft bait lure that provided the flexible attributes of traditional lures, while increasing its strength and decreasing the likelihood of its being lost and becoming an environmental risk.\r\n</p><p>In November 2006, with the help of Osswald, whose research interests include engineering design with plastics and sustainability, Hobbins devised a unique fiber-reinforced soft plastic lure that implemented skin grafting principles from his previous experience in the biotechnology industry. The results and their implications were astounding.\r\n</p><p>\\"[The fibers] are placed in such a way that you still have the flexible lure, but you can\\''t rip it,\\" Osswald says. The mechanism behind the strength of the bond of lure and hook derives from a fabrication process that embeds microscopic fibers into the plastic polymer. As a result, the lure is significantly less likely to disengage or break off the hook. \\"[The lures] are stiffer to the pull if you stretch them, but they\\''re still flexible and deliver the desired performance,\\" Osswald says.\r\n</p><p>The advantages of this new lure are quite evident. First, the increased strength of the lure means that anglers will save money in the long run, as the new lure is built to last.  As a result, those fishers using Hobbins\\''s lures will enjoy a greater ratio of fish caught per lure. Secondly, there is a much smaller risk that the ecosystem will be inundated with thousands of tons of environmentally harmful plastics.\r\n</p><p> \\"It adds a lot of pleasure to the fishing experience and allows anglers to catch many more fish,\\" Hobbins says. \\"It also stops soft-plastic waste in the environment.\\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the lure was developed, Hobbins took his innovation to the Wisconsin school of business. Phil Kim, an assistant professor who teaches entrepreneurship, challenged his students to devise a business model for the lure. \\"It puts the classroom learning into a bigger context. And also in the end, in many cases, [the students] have an opportunity to influence the way the business owner is running their business,\\" Kim says.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKim\\''s students set out to capture and analyze valuable data on the market of plastic soft lures, especially metrics that had not previously been studied. \\"They came up with some hard numbers that now are applied in market research as viable for the industry,\\" Hobbins says. </p><p>\r\nSince then, Hobbins\\'' microfiber-based plastic soft lures, officially marketed as \\"IronClad Lures,\\" have garnered many accolades and have been featured in magazines. Popular Science, for instance, honored the lure as a top ten invention of 2009 in their June, 2009 issue. Available at national sporting good chains, the lure is competitively priced with conventional plastic lures. \r\nThe IronClad plastic soft lure is a boon to sport fishermen and a tribute to the state of the environment. The history of how the lure came to fruition is truly an example of the entrepreneurial process: a merging of idea, engineering and business. While Hobbins succeeded with the help of Osswald, Kim, and a business class, there is one more thanks he would like to give.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\\"I owe the Wisconsin system-which strongly supports entrepreneurship and technology invention-much credit for the success of our project,\\" Hobbins says.\r\n</p>', 'Anthony Lai', 'Anthony is a senior majoring in computer engineering and political science.

One group that became involved in the issue was the Trace Research & Development Center. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img border=\\"0\\" src=\\"../nov09/Nov09Trace4.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Dr. Gregg Vanderheiden demos the Trace Center software with the \\"banned\\" episode of the children\\''s show Pok&eacute;mon</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Trace Center, which is part of the UW-Madison college of engineering, has become a world-wide leader in research efforts to address the problem of web- and television-triggered seizures in people with a condition called photosensitive seizure disorder. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDr. Gregg Vanderheiden founded the Trace Center 38 years ago. Since then, the center has grown to occupy its own office suites in the Engineering Centers Building, and it boasts a long list of developments that improve accessibility for the disabled. Many of the projects that the Trace Center has taken on have been the very first ideas of their kind and remain the only product of their type available. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\\"The problem is, most people don\\''t know they have a seizure disorder until they have a seizure,\\" Vanderheiden says. When the Trace Center first took on the photosensitive seizure project about ten years ago, Vanderheiden went straight to the leading expert in the field, Dr. Graham Harding, of Great Britain\\''s Aston University. During an interview with Vanderheiden, Harding provided a brief description of the condition: \\"Photosensitive epilepsy is a condition in which people have seizures or attacks or fits when they are presented with a visual stimulus. It\\''s not very common; whereas epilepsy is common, photosensitive epilepsy occurs in approximately 1 in 4000 of the population.\\" \r\n</p><p>\r\nHarding and his team developed a new tool for television broadcasters to use to evaluate each program to determine if it had the ability to cause seizures. The only drawback of this tool was its incredible expense, costing about $20,000. Complications arose further when some governments in Europe wanted to try to regulate television and website content through legislation. This was difficult to do without making clear-cut, \\"yes-no\\" rules, because flashing and bright colors are not dangerous to individuals with photosensitive seizure disorder until they reach a certain level.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\\"You couldn\\''t have a rule, if the only tool cost $20,000.\\" Vanderheiden says. \\"What we wanted to do was provide good advice to people on what to do and [deliver] a tool that was free that they could use to determine if what they were doing was dangerous.\\"\r\n</p><p>\r\nTrace developed the first set of web content guidelines that were later picked up by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and refined into what is now the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. Vanderheiden is a co-chair of a group of volunteers from the web page development industry who came together to write the W3C Recommendations under the WCAG 2.0. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn developing the tool to help people follow these guidelines, the Trace group started with the ideas Harding and his team had already developed. They licensed the underlying algorithms for a sum of money, allowing them to distribute the information free of charge. Some adaptations needed to be made to the original software because it was specific to television programs and did not address internet content.

('feb10water', 'Something in the water', 'article', 'An overview of Wisconsin\\''s water quality.', 'February', 2010, '<p>In 1993, over the span of just two weeks, more than 400,000 Milwaukee residents fell sick with cramps, fever, dehydration and diarrhea. The culprit for this mass illness? A tiny protozoan called cryptosporidium, which snuck its way into the Howard Avenue Water Purification Plant and was distributed to nearly 900,000 residents. One hundred people died from the outbreak.</p>\r\n<p>One may have expected such an outbreak to occur in a developing nation with unstable infrastructure, but not as close to home as Milwaukee. Luckily, water treatment engineers from all around the country paid attention to this incident and have taken measures to try to prevent it from happening again. Despite their best efforts, however, harmful contaminants still pop up in our drinking water from time to time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“[Recent studies] have found viruses [in the groundwater],” Ken Potter, professor of civil and environmental engineering at UW-Madison, says. “Not only that, but they have found viruses that are less than a year old. The viruses aren’t a problem because we chlorinate our water, but it’s a little scary. It’s an indicator that we have to always be on guard … One should never get overconfident as an engineer or as a citizen.”</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it seems that we take our drinking water for granted as it streams from our showers and kitchen sinks. What we often fail to consider is the extensive engineering that goes into the mechanical and chemical systems that bring our water to us cleanly. Thanks to tough water regulations and efficiently engineered systems, there’s virtually no chance that cryptosporidium will attack again.</p>\r\n<p>“I’m confident that the regulations we have in place … are enough to ensure the public that there’s a very low risk of getting cryptosporidiosis from drinking water now,” professor of civil and environmental Greg Harrington says. “When they turn on the tap to get a glass of water, they can be confident that they’re not going to get cryptosporidiosis.”</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, the geological formations from which most of Wisconsin gets its drinking water mostly keep contaminants like cryptosporidium from reaching drinking water to begin with. Public water systems in Milwaukee, however, draw from surface waters like Lake Michigan, which is vulnerable to any contaminants that can find their way into the lake.</p>\r\n<p>Madison is just one of many cities in Wisconsin that draws its water from the estimated 1.2 quadrillion gallons of water that lie beneath the surface. The Madison city wells drill about 600-700 feet below the surface into a deep sandstone aquifer. Above this main, deep aquifer, there is a shallow aquifer separated by a layer of shale. In theory, the shale should keep anything that has contaminated the shallow aquifer from leaking into the deep aquifer. However, this may not be the whole story.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/water_pipe.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">A thick layer of off-white calcium and magnesium has built up inside this brown pipe taken from a water processing plant.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s some recent literature that suggests that maybe the geologic formations don’t provide as much filtration as we like to believe they do. But in Madison … we add chlorine when the water comes out of the ground, and then we provide an adequate contact time with that chlorine before we send the water out to the distribution systems,” Harrington says. “The calculations that have been done suggest that we use adequate contact time to kill viruses that might be present in the water supply. There’s no evidence that people are getting sick from the water here.”</p>\r\n<p>The State of Wisconsin recently decided that all groundwater supplies in the state are vulnerable to contaminants and must be disinfected. Most municipalities, like Madison, chose to disinfect with chlorine, but this technique is sometimes controversial.</p>\r\n<p>“I see [it] as a benefit; I think it’s a good idea,” Harrington says. “But there are some communities that will not like it because they’ll be tasting chlorine in their water for the first time.” However, Harrington offers a simple solution. “[T]ake a bottle and collect some tap water and put the bottle in the refrigerator. When the water’s cold, you don’t taste the chlorine as much.”</p>\r\n<p>Homeowners can also buy water filters that take chlorine out of the water, but removing chlorine encourages bacterial growth. “Studies on all of these [filters] find microorganisms growing on them … so it’s a tradeoff. Do you want to drink the bugs or do you want to drink the chlorine?” Harrington says. “I’m not convinced that the water is any healthier coming out of a filter than it is out of the tap to begin with. For the people that feel better protected by using a filter, I just strongly encourage them to maintain that piece of equipment in accordance with the recommended schedules because those devices can ultimately do more harm than good if they are not adequately maintained.”</p>\r\n<p>Taste isn’t the only concern related to chlorination, though. When chlorine reacts with natural organic matter it can form potential cancer-causing substances like chloroform. For the past 30 years, chlorine by-products have been regulated by taking natural organic matter out of water before treating it with chlorine.</p>\r\n<p>Some communities that have chosen not to employ chlorine met the disinfected water regulation using ozonation, which infuses O3 through the water to kill microorganisms. Others use UV light treatment, in which light of a very short wavelength is applied to the water to destroy viruses and bacteria. “[Each of these systems] has their own set of by-products, but we have ways of engineering treatment plants to minimize the formation of those things,” Harrington says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/water_graph.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Despite the public’s concerns over water safety, most contaminants found in Madison drinking water are much lower than their legal limits.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>One type of contaminant that has been garnering a lot of attention over the past few years and isn’t treated by chlorination is pharmaceutical waste. Medication remnants are introduced to the water system when users excrete them into wastewater. When the treated wastewater is put back into the system—either poured into surface waters or recharged into groundwater aquifers—the pharmaceuticals go with it.</p>\r\n<p>The concern for pharmaceuticals in drinking water is relatively new, and as a result, regulations have been slow to develop. “We just don’t have the studies to set standards on them yet,” Harrington says. “Utilities have gone through programs to look for these substances in water and they know they’re there, but they just don’t know what to do about them yet.”</p>\r\n<p>Despite the presence of such contaminants, experts on water treatment assure that our drinking water is safe. “By and large, the municipal water supplies in the state are safe,” Harrington says. “I’ll drink the water anywhere I go.”</p>\r\n<p>Quality isn’t the only thing some communities need to consider with drinking water. Luckily for us, Madison has a solid supply of drinking water, but other communities are concerned about the amounts they are using. For instance, Waukesha County has been using water at about twice the rate that it is recharging in the deep aquifer.</p>\r\n<p>“They’ve been taking water from the shallow aquifers. It’s not as reliable of a supply, and it’s lower quality,” Potter says. “Also, if you take that water out, you’re going to reduce groundwater flows to streams and lakes, so you’re going to degrade natural systems.”</p>\r\n<p>A major factor that slows the recharge of these aquifers is development. Impervious surfaces, such as parking lots and roads, prevent water from infiltrating back into the ground. While this is a serious issue elsewhere, it’s not such a problem in Madison, since the developed area is so small compared to the farmland around it. Instead, Madison faces a different problem caused by the impervious surfaces: “Madison actually has to worry about the excess runoff that goes into the lakes and causes flooding. That’s a huge issue,” Potter says.</p>\r\n<p>For those communities concerned with their groundwater supply, however, there is hope. “One solution that could be a lot more effective if we continue to use it is to infiltrate storm water using design practice. That practice can be a so-called rain garden or it could be something that’s more engineered,” Potter says. A rain garden is just a small depression in the soil to which you can route runoff from a roof, parking lot or other impervious surface. The area can be used to grow plants, hence the name. “These things, if they are properly designed, can not only make up for the impervious area, but they can make up for some of the pumping,” Potter says.</p>\r\n<p>Potter himself recently bought rain barrels that collect roof runoff and drain into the lawn, reducing the need to water it. Practices such as this not only increase infiltration into the groundwater, but also reduce the amount of storm water that drains into the lakes and causes flooding. “[Stormwater recharge] is a pretty powerful solution. The challenges are getting people to do it and do it right,” Potter says.</p>\r\n<p>Those concerned about a Madison water shortage need not worry—at least for now. “We’re not going to have a problem in the long term,” Potter says, “[but] we haven’t come close to conserving.”</p>', 'Dylan Liebl', '', 'Kristen Juve', 'Alex Bird', '2010-02-02', NULL);

As you stumble home Friday after class, all you can think about is how good your pillow will feel on your tired face when you fall into bed for an afternoon nap. But while you and many other UW-Madison students are off to sleep the daylight away, members of the Wisconsin Hybrid Vehicle Team are just reporting for duty at the Engineering Centers Building. Their goal? To develop a hybrid car that could benefit all of humanity. Does this make you feel lazy? Join the club!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/hybrid_engine.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The hybrid team will make use of a two-cylinder engine borrowed from the UW-Madison clean snowmobile team that runs on E-85.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Hybrid Vehicle Team is a student organization that works to develop and improve techniques to make the world’s vehicles more efficient and less harmful to the environment. The team consists of nearly 60 members from all disciplines in the college of engineering.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1992, the Hybrid Vehicle Team has participated in a national competition called the EcoCAR challenge. The EcoCAR challenge is a three-year engineering competition in which collegiate teams from all across the country design advanced vehicle propulsion systems that focus on alternative energy methods. The teams then implement their systems in vehicles donated by General Motors. Despite tough competition from across the country, UW-Madison has experienced great success in the past. The last competition, called the Challenge X, wrapped up in June 2008. UW-Madison’s vehicle finished second out of seventeen teams.</p>\r\n<p>The current EcoCAR competition is titled the NeXt Challenge. The Hybrid Team is currently in year two of this competition. The first year involved theoretical development, in which math-based computer systems were employed to test ideas fleshed out by the team. Now in year two of the NeXt voyage, the team has just received the 2009 Saturn Vue they will be modifying. According to assistant team leader Adam Strutz, the next step will be to dismantle and revamp the entire power train.</p>\r\n<p>“The whole team displays a little bit more energy when the vehicle arrives. You can start to see your work paying off firsthand, not just on a computer screen,” Strutz says.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/hybrid_car.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">In addition to revamping the inside of the car, the Hybrid Vehicle Team customizes the outside to represent UW-Madison.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>All the materials utilized by the team—including the car—do not just appear out of thin air. The major sponsors for the competition include the US Department of Energy, the Government of Canada, the California Air Resources Board and General Motors (GM). General Motors donates a vehicle (this year it’s the Saturn Vue) to each of the 17 teams competing across North America. The teams are also allotted $10,000 worth of parts courtesy of GM to work into their respective vehicles.</p>\r\n<p>One benefit for both GM and Hybrid Team members is that GM looks at participants for future employment. Hybrid members already know about GM’s software and components, thus GM is able to hire them and expect a contributing employee almost immediately. However, the team members make it clear the possibility of future employment is just an added bonus. The real fulfillment is getting to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real world situations. Members must rely on their own investigation and analysis to acquire knowledge, rather than relying on the pages of a text book.</p>\r\n<p>While many student groups may meet for only an hour or two per week, the Hybrid Vehicle Team is a much more substantial commitment. Adam Richards, the team leader, explains that the team has small group meetings throughout the week for the three different areas of the competition: controls, business and mechanical. Full team meetings take place on Fridays. It’s during this time that actual work is completed on the car. The meetings start at 3:30 p.m. and can extend into the wee hours of the morning. In the team office there is a board with members’ names on it. Under each name lie tallies for the number of all-nighters the member has completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/hybrid_dude.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Assistant team under Adam Strutz shows where each of the engine components will go in the currently empty engine bay.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“If we have a report that is due the next day by noon, members are staying there all night to make sure it gets done. Writing reports of our testing would probably be the least favorite part of the group activities,” Richards says. “The most rewarding part of development is when you’ve done all the testing on the computer, written the reports, and you’re able to implement your ideas into the actual vehicle and see it all work; all of the hard work paying off.”</p>\r\n<p>With all the long hours the team spends together, strong friendships form. Zack Ward, a member of the mechanical group, says that members often get together outside of meetings to have a cold, refreshing beverage and enjoy a Badger football game.</p>\r\n<p>As the team continues work on the Saturn Vue this semester, all members look excitedly to the month of May. The competition will be held in Yuma, Arizona this year at GM’s new proving ground. At the competition, the team will be evaluated on 0-60 mph acceleration time, emissions, drive quality and new this year, towing events.</p>\r\n<p>As the team develops the vehicle throughout the year, they must meet the reduced emissions goal, while maintaining the vehicles’ performance and consumer appeal. “One of the challenges we face is packaging, fitting everything into the space allotted. No one wants a huge battery pack sitting in the back of their vehicle,” Strutz says.</p>\r\n<p>To meet the many goals of the competition, the team must show dedication, but also resourcefulness. The team exemplified this inventiveness in the last competition two years ago when they took over The Kohl Center. This arena is known for housing some epic battles on the ice rink, but the Hybrid Vehicle Team saw the sheet of ice as a great place to test their traction control systems in preparation for the competition.</p>\r\n<p>As UW-Madison is a major hub for ground-breaking research, it seems fitting that there is such a focus on alternative energy methods on campus. So if you meet a member of the Hybrid Vehicle Team tell them thank you, because you know they are working to preserve this planet we call home. And best of all? They have fun doing it.</p>', 'Ben Weight', '', 'Danny Marchewka', 'Alex Bird', '2010-02-02', NULL),

UW-Madison has ranked in the top five public research universities based on total expenditures for the last two decades. This year is shaping up a little differently because UW-Madison, like many research institutions, is receiving millions of dollars from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This single act has drastically changed the landscape of research funding in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>As of early November 2009, researchers at UW-Madison had been awarded 235 grants totaling $78.4 million in stimulus money. The money found its way from Washington, D.C. to UW-Madison through several organizations, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy. These organizations award the money to deserving research teams through a competitive process that evaluates all aspects of the proposed research, with special emphasis on collaboration and interdisciplinary research.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/research_group.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Research efforts, like that of John Wallace, have been bolstered by the federal stimulus, with UW-Madison receiving over $78 million.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the organizations that currently has the most influence on UW-Madison researchers is the National Science Foundation (<span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span>). So far, the <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span> has been allotted $2.4 billion of the stimulus package. The <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span>, like many other governmental agencies, has many smaller divisions and programs that ultimately decide how money is allocated.</p>\r\n<p>One such program is the Academic Research Infrastructure program (<span class=\\"caps\\">ARI</span>). The <span class=\\"caps\\">ARI</span> program will award a total of $200 million strictly for making repairs and renovations to our nation’s research facilities. The <span class=\\"caps\\">ARI</span> program not only helps to create construction jobs, it also sets the stage for cutting edge science.</p>\r\n<p>“[President Obama] is depending on <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span> to help lead the nation to a new era of discovery and innovation,” <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span> director Arden Bement says.</p>\r\n<p>To fill the newly renovated facilities, the Major Research Instrumentation (<span class=\\"caps\\">MRI</span>) program at <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span> has been allotted $300 million to help researchers purchase state-of-the-art equipment. This equipment helps foster research and education, thus breathing life into the newly renovated infrastructure. These <span class=\\"caps\\">MRI</span> grants carry the stipulation that they can only be awarded to institutions with an emphasis on education, such as universities, museums and science centers.</p>\r\n<p>All of the grants made possible by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act serve the two very broad purposes of stimulating the economy and advancing science through research. The first purpose is pretty clear. The latter, however, is limited only by the curiosity and inspiration of the research teams. Advancing science could mean exploring hazards to our health, curing diseases and cleaning up the environment. At UW-Madison, researchers are working on all three.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, like bacteriology professor Tim Donohue and biochemistry professor John Ralph, have received a grant totaling $8.1 million to investigate the sustainability of biofuels and their effectiveness as a renewable energy source. This project will analyze a broad spectrum of impacts associated with biofuels. Donohue acknowledges that the stimulus package has allowed for the quick deployment of new technology used for the analysis of cellulosic biofuels that may have otherwise taken a long time to arrange.</p>\r\n<p>Medical research at UW-Madison is another focus of funding for the stimulus package. Professor of chemical engineering Regina Murphy received $800,000 to continue her research into blocking the effects of Alzheimer’s disease. Veterinary epidemiologist Dörte Döpfer and professor of bacteriology Charles Kaspar were the recipients of a grant totaling $1 million to help gain an understanding of the E. coli bacteria. Their research will investigate how the bacteria survive in certain environments. Hopefully, their findings will reduce the chance of human infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/research_cad.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Conceptual drawing of Professor Forest’s Madison Plasma Dynamo Experiment (MPDX), a project made possible by the federal stimulus money.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The goals of the stimulus package are certainly met by professor of physics Cary Forest’s project, which is currently constructing a lab that will be used to study plasma-generated electric fields. The lab will be the first of its kind, attempting to explain astrophysical properties that are not yet understood, specifically the origin of the sun’s magnetic field.</p>\r\n<p>“We proposed to build [the lab]. It’s a construction project,” Forest says. For this project, Forest received a grant totaling $2.4 million from the National Science Foundation, $1.7 million of which came from the stimulus package. “We see the infrastructure as a mechanism for developing a long term relationship with <span class=\\"caps\\">NSF</span>. This sets up maybe a decade of funding to follow,” Forest says.</p>\r\n<p>Forest notes that the funding for construction will support a full time engineer as well as hourly paid undergraduate students who will help to build the lab. “It might even pay for pizza to feed them,” Forest says with a laugh.</p>\r\n<p>“My read is that most of my colleagues are benefiting in one way or another,” Forest says, when asked about his perception of how the stimulus package is impacting research. “It’s mostly because there’s a little less pressure on the system. It makes it possible to win grants that weren’t otherwise likely to be funded.”</p>\r\n<p>Even if a project were likely to be funded, an influx of money from the stimulus package provides far-reaching scientific and economic impacts. This means that deserving research teams that might have fallen just short in their competitive grant process can now go forth with their projects, thanks to stimulus money. The result will be more innovation as well as more constructing of labs, new equipment, more campus research and more jobs.</p>\r\n<p>These examples are only a glimpse of the expansive list of researchers who are currently benefiting from the stimulus package at UW-Madison. The list is growing as the stimulus money flows into campus. Over the course of writing this story, the sum of stimulus money has  increased by $3 million dollars. Researchers here at UW-Madison are continually trying to get their hands on funding while it is available, so that they might get a needed boost for their research.</p>\r\n<p>For more details on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act at UW-Madison, go to www.stimulus.wisc.edu.</p>\r\n', 'Marcus Hawkins ', '', 'Kevin Lee', 'Alex Bird', '2010-02-02', NULL),
('feb10threed', 'Hollywood in the third dimension', 'article', '3-D movies have always had depth, but will new technologies finally make them hold some weight?', 'February', 2010, '<p>The history of Hollywood filmmaking has been marked by distinct eras. Silent movies were replaced with “talkies,” and black-and-white pictures made way for color flicks. In the future, this decade may be seen as the end of another era: the 2-D era.</p>\r\n<p>Stereoscopic 3-D motion picture technology predates the 20th century and is almost as old as the motion picture camera itself. 3-D film experienced some success in the 1950s and 1980s, but earlier versions often left audiences with eye fatigue and nausea. Today, industry executives claim these side effects are in the past. 3-D movies are making a push for market share with strong financial backing from theater chains and studios, which are beginning to turn out more 3-D films.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/threed_obama.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">3-D technology is gaining popularity in the home market, even with the First Family.  This summer the 2010 World Cup will be on ESPN 3-D for home-viewing.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From its inception to the present, 3-D film technology has operated on the same principles. When a pair of eyes focuses on an object, the brain receives two slightly different images. The brain can process differences in the images, called ocular disparities, allowing one to perceive depth. 3-D films are made using two cameras filming scenes side-by-side, similar to a pair of eyes. In the theater, the images are projected onto the screen through two different filters. The images reach the correct eye of the viewer through another set of filters—the viewer’s 3-D glasses.</p>\r\n<p>While the concept hasn’t changed, modern 3-D movies and the drive-in 3-D flicks of yesteryear aren’t exactly working with the same tools.</p>\r\n<p>The driving force behind the new wave of 3-D movies is a technology called RealD. RealD differs from past methods of projecting 3-D movies in that it only uses one projector. The images for the left and right eyes are alternated at 144 frames per second, six times the rate of traditional film. Moviegoers are given clear, circularly polarized glasses, which do not block out light when the head is tilted or produce washed out colors like the red and cyan glasses of old.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, new 3-D cameras have improved from their predecessors. Esteemed director James Cameron, one of the largest supporters of 3-D cinema, has pioneered a camera system that he thinks can finally do 3-D films justice. The switch from traditional film cameras to high-definition digital cameras means that the lenses can be separated from the bulky recorders. The smaller size allows the lenses to be placed only a few inches apart, replicating the distance between human eyes. A camera operator can shift the angles of the lenses to simulate converging pupils, creating an experience that is much more true-to-life and doesn’t cause nearly as much strain on the eyes.</p>\r\n<p>To industry executives, this new technology has big potential. DreamWorks’ animation chief executive officer Jeffrey Katzenberg praised the new RealD technology at the International Broadcasting Convention in late 2008. “I think in a reasonable period of time, all movies are going to be made in 3-D,” Katzenberg says. “2-D films are going to be a thing of the past.”</p>\r\n<p>If the trends of the last few years continue, Katzenberg may be right; 11 major 3-D films or shorts were screened in 2007, 14 in 2008 and 21 in 2009. The increase in pictures has been met with an enthusiastic response from audiences. DreamWorks’ “Monsters vs. Aliens” pulled in $58.2 million over 7,000 screens, 2,100 of which played in 3-D. According to Katzenberg, 56 percent of the ticket sales were for 3-D showings. The drastic increase in per-screen revenue is enough indication for the DreamWorks’ executive to promise that all of his future films will be released in 3-D.</p>\r\n<p>This enthusiasm is shared by director Cameron, who sees 3-D movies as a way to slow down internet piracy, a problem that has plagued digital films.</p>\r\n<p>“I’m not going to make movies for people to watch on their cell phones,” Cameron said during his keynote address at the Digital Cinema Summit in Las Vegas in 2006. If anyone has a say over the future of Hollywood, it’s Cameron, renowned director of “The Terminator” (1984) and “Titanic” (1997). Cameron’s next picture, “Avatar,” was released in December 2009 with rumors circulating that this film could be more successful than his past blockbusters.

But what if that computer was a living organism—a computer that was completely sustainable because it acquired energy from food and processed it biologically in the same way that your body does? The emerging field of synthetic biology holds hopes such as this, and professor of chemical and biological engineering Brian Pfleger and his team are at the forefront of the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/pfleger_solo.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Pfleger uses incubators to culture bacterial cells. The cells can be genetically manipulated to produce fatty acids and biodiesel precursors.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From his office in Engineering Hall, which conveniently overlooks the biotechnology building across University Avenue, Professor Pfleger leads a dozen or so undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral researchers through this emerging field. Having earned his Ph.D. in chemical engineering a mere four and a half years ago from the University of California – Berkeley, Pfleger and his team are making remarkable headway. They aren’t the only ones either. “Things are flying out of the literature faster than we can analyze them and build them into our projects,” Pfleger says of research in synthetic biology around the world.</p>\r\n<p>Pfleger’s venture into the field of biotechnology was anything but deliberate. He originally planned to pursue a career in pharmaceuticals. “I had a misconception that if I wanted to work in the pharmaceutical industry I had to learn biology. Along the way I discovered that biotechnology is a really fascinating idea. If you can understand the metabolism in a cell, you can understand diseases, the ability to produce compounds and many more amazing things,” Pfleger says.</p>\r\n<p>The advantages of using a biological system, also called an organism, to make a product or perform a task is that the energy used to do the work is completely sustainable. Biological systems run on sugars and harvest the energy stored in the biomolecules to perform work. For instance, take a look at your coffee maker. Normally, you plug the coffee maker into an outlet to give it the electricity it needs to make your morning brew. If this appliance was a product of synthetic biology, instead of plugging in your coffee maker, you would feed it biomolecules from which it would produce the energy it needs to operate.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s taking the viewpoint that biology is like any other complex engineering system. It’s a series of parts that are built on one another and interact with one another,” Pfleger says. “The idea is that you understand the parts that perform a biological function, and you understand how they interact with one another, and then you can build a system. You can build a cell. You can build a chemical factory inside a bacterium.”</p>\r\n<p>Here at UW-Madison, Pfleger’s group is implementing techniques to synthesize biofuels. “What we are doing is making diesel fuel in bacteria,” Pfleger says. The designer bacteria produce certain fatty acids that can be processed into the same types of petroleum precursors that enter refineries today to make hydrocarbon fuels like gasoline and diesel fuel.</p>\r\n<p>Pfleger and his team have hopes to improve this process so that the bacteria can produce the diesel fuel directly. “It’s a matter of whether you know which genes do the job you want and whether you can get them to work,” Pfleger says. By inserting the correct genes into the bacteria’s genome, the organism can theoretically produce the tools it needs to process the precursor fatty acids directly into the hydrocarbon fuel that enters refineries. Gaining the ability to do so would eliminate an expensive process that is currently needed to decarboxylize the product before it can be fed into a refinery.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/pfleger_student.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Professor Pfleger (right) works closely with his graduate students, such as Daniel Mendez Perez (left), providing continuous feedback and insight from his knowldge in the field of synthetic biology.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ideal sustainable situation for energy production, the net output of the process equals the input. Our current ways of producing energy are far from reaching such efficiency. “[With our current methods], we’re taking energy out of the ground. It’s carbon that was fixed a long, long time ago, and we’re combusting it and putting carbon dioxide out in the atmosphere. So from a carbon dioxide perspective, that is not sustainable. We would like everything we are burning to have been captured recently,” Pfleger says. Bacteria that produce diesel fuel are thus ideal candidates for this task, since they get their energy from metabolizing recently produced biomass, not a nonrenewable resource that will run out.</p>\r\n<p>Pfleger’s research and laboratory are funded by the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (<span class=\\"caps\\">GLBRC</span>), which is a collaboration of universities and national labs, most of which are located in the Midwest. One of the efforts of the <span class=\\"caps\\">GLBRC</span> is to convert cellulosic biomass into advanced biofuels. In addition to Pfleger’s research with the center, there is research being done to engineer plants that produce ideal biomass for the bacteria to turn into fuel. “What is really exciting about this center is that it’s taking people from all over campus,” Pfleger says. “You’ve got the whole spectrum from chemistry, physics, math, engineering and biochemistry and they are all working together towards the same large problem.”</p>\r\n<p>Pfleger’s work in synthetic biology doesn’t stop at the <span class=\\"caps\\">GLBRC</span>. His research has inspired the design of a new lab course in the college of engineering that teaches students the techniques “they need to understand in order to do synthetic biology research,” Pfleger says.</p>\r\n<p>The hopes for this new and exciting field of synthetic biology is that scientists will have the technology to build organisms from the ground up that are programmed to produce a desired product or perform a certain function. The next generation of biotechnology aims to utilize the ability to build a cell that acts as a chemical factory and to design communication between that cell and another. A synthetic biological organism would theoretically have the ability to send electrical signals from cell to cell, similar to the technology of a computer. In this way, Pfleger’s novel research provides tremendous opportunity for the merging of biology and engineering.</p>', 'Melody Pierson', '', 'Thai Nguyen', 'Alex Bird', '2010-02-03', NULL),

Covering 680 square feet, <span class=\\"caps\\">ENIAC</span> could add and subtract two numbers and hold a 10-digit value in its memory at the rate of about 5,000 operations per second. In contrast, your iPod, performs about 2.4 billion operations per second and fits in the palm of your hand. For more than 60 years, we have been working to make computers smaller and faster, and we have succeeded tremendously.</p>\r\n<p>But how small can we get with our technology? Traditional physics would tell us that the smallest possible computing components require several electrons per bit. New research into the quantum world, however, tells us differently. Quantum computation is changing the way we think about computers-everything from how we process complex calculations to how we protect information on the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"left\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/qubit_nano.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">Preparing a chip like the one shown can take weeks due to the qubit\\''s need for optimal voltages.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us are shamelessly dependent on computers in our daily lives. However, we often neglect the complex hardware that fuels our electronic devices. Consumers need only worry about the next fastest, smallest and sleekest device to execute our every command. As these devices get smaller and smaller, though, our current computer technology fast approaches its physical limit.</p>\r\n<p>“The old philosophy about computers … was to get smaller and smaller gate sizes,” Robert Blick, professor of electrical and computer engineering, says. “Now we only need a couple thousand electrons to get a one and zero. Even recent flash memories are down to five or ten electrons. [Computing] is really going down to single particles, but sooner or later you reach a physical limitation. Then you must address the wave function of the particle: the quantum information.”</p>\r\n<p>This is where the qubit comes in. A qubit is a unit of quantum information described by the wave function of a particle, which defines the probability of an electron’s physical state at a given time. Unlike a traditional computing bit, which can be either a 0 or a 1, a qubit can be a 0, 1 or a combination of both.</p>\r\n<p>“We are revising our ideas about what information really is, because quantum mechanics tells us that if you look at bits on a finer and finer scale, the standard idea of the 0/1 bit goes away. There isn’t any really small thing that acts like a classical bit,” computer sciences professor Eric Bach says. Observing the quantum state of matter in real-time is difficult, however, because of the incredibly small scale and the dynamic nature of particles.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Blick leads one UW-Madison research group studying quantum computing. With the help of graduate student Hyuncheol Shin (Caleb), the team is focusing on the development of qubits in semiconductors called quantum dots. Semiconductors are a special type of material whose electrical conductivity can be controlled. Because of this unique property, semiconductors are responsible for several recognizable technologies, including the <span class=\\"caps\\">LED</span> monitor on your personal computer. Working with quantum dots is exceedingly difficult because of the time it takes to prepare the dot, requirement of cryogenic temperatures and extreme signal sensitivity to internal and external noise.</p>\r\n<p>Donning the full-body white lab suit, Caleb first prepares a single quantum dot in a clean room by trapping an electron on a semiconductor chip. To do so, he uses electrically charged nanoscale metal gates to create a potential well on the two dimensional electron gas blanketing the semiconductor surface. These gates can confine electrons and control the number of electrons in the potential well.  Such a system is known as a top-gated quantum dot.</p>\r\n<p>“The forming work of the dot is very challenging, so you spend a lot of time optimizing gate voltages to have good dots,” Caleb says. “It is not given for free.” Preparing a chip can take a few weeks because the top gate voltages must be perfectly tuned to define desirable potential well and barriers.</p>\r\n<p>Once constructed, the chip is placed under a shimmering-gold cryogenic freezer that resembles a death ray from a James Bond film. Liquid helium cools the freezer, plummeting the chip temperature to tenths of degrees Kelvin; cold enough to slow atomic movement to a crawl.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\\"right\\">\r\n<img src=\\"../feb10/images/qubit_machine.jpg\\" width=\\"250\\" alt=\\"\\" />\r\n<div class=\\"caption\\">The cryogenic freezer, used to plummet the chip temperature within degrees of absolute zero, slows atomic movement on the semiconductor chip to a crawl.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“These are like artificial atoms slowed down so you know where the individual electrons are,” Bach says.</p>\r\n<p>Once the system is cooled, Caleb observes the electron current and attempts to optimize the electron spin lifetime, called the coherence time, with radio frequency pulses. It is this electron spin that enables quantum data storage. Scores of data are collected during each run through a network of current amplifiers, voltmeters and other electronics stacked nearly ten feet high next the cryogenic freezer. Similar to a computer monitor, these devices receive and display the quantum information from a single qubit.</p>\r\n<p>The experimental procedure allows Caleb to measure the qubit coherence time, which essentially determines if the top-gated technique will store information long enough to be utilized in computation.</p>\r\n<p>“A coherence lifetime of a couple milliseconds is still long enough to perform maybe a thousand gate operations if the gate operations are fast enough,” Blick says. “If you have a thousand gate operations you can do some computation, which might … be sufficient for coding.”</p>\r\n<p>“One of the reasons people are very excited about quantum computing is that it gives the effect of computing on many inputs at the same time. Normally if you have a computer you have n bits, then you can only put those n bits in one state and operate on it to get a result,” Bach says. “With a quantum computer there is, at least in principle, the possibility of having operations going on for all of those 2n states at the same time.” Because these quantum computers have the potential to be exponentially more powerful than classical computational methods, they are applicable in the most complex of computational problems.</p>\r\n<p>Not every aspect of this computational power is desirable, however. Once scaled up to accommodate the size of online security codes, quantum systems could break the encryption of nearly any security code on the internet, anything from your email to your bank account password.</p>\r\n<p>Although true quantum computers are limited by our current technological understanding, small supplemental quantum registers may enhance our current computational processes. “Another interesting thing is that even if you could not go all the way to a realization of [true quantum computation], you could use tens of qubits to speed up classical computation, a hybrid algorithm that uses quantum computation to focus in on the solutions that you could then explore classically,” Bach says.</p>\r\n<p>Future quantum computing technologies, including Blick’s quantum dots, could also be integrated into quantum optical equipment, which is currently available. “You can dream up applications where the quantum cascade lasers are integrated in the qubit chip where you use the light from the quantum cascade lasers to flip the qubit states,” Blick says. “Quantum optics equipment could be integrated into these systems to transfer information over larger distances.” Such technologies will also help merge classical computational devices and emerging quantum technologies in the future.</p>\r\n<p>A final application of quantum computing is realized in biology; specifically, simulation for sequencing amino acids in proteins. “Biologists need to do simulations in which they use a couple of super computers that take forever,” Caleb says. “If they have quantum computers it might boost biological sciences, and engineering too.”</p>\r\n<p>“Quantum computing is still a very primitive technology … Definitely, I can tell you, [a quantum computer] wouldn’t be like a consumer electronics laptop,” Caleb says. “The first configuration would be a super-big, room-size computer like the first computer, the <span class=\\"caps\\">ENICA</span>.” Despite its large size, such a quantum computer with a few thousand qubits, could rival the computational power of today’s more advanced machines. How we use such computing power will need to be decided when we get there.</p>\r\n<p>In time, quantum computing may be integrated into the most complex computer systems owned by the government or multibillion dollar corporations.

('feb10pandemic', 'How to control the pan(dem)ic', 'article', 'Important information about how to prepare and respond to a pandemic like H1N1.', 'February', 2010, '<p>It is a question that most people hope will never need answering. What should be done in response to a widespread and possibly deadly flu pandemic? For the government, the answer may be setting aside funds from an already thin budget to help treat sick citizens. For some companies, the answer might be shutting down, leaving thousands unemployed but less susceptible to the disease. For students at UW-Madison, the answer might be canceling an entire football season or shortening the academic semester. These are certainly drastic measures to be taken in case of a deadly flu pandemic, but they may be necessary to ensure a healthier population.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>A flu pandemic is something that researchers have feared for a long time, and some believe it could be more fatal than any natural disaster or war. Imagine millions of people infected with a deadly virus that cannot be immediately combated with any medication. Thousands could be forced to miss work, resulting in a crumbling economy. And here on the UW-Madison campus and at college campuses all around the world, students will be at very high risk because of the close proximity to each other in classrooms and dorms. Thankfully, researchers around the United States are preparing for such a flu pandemic so that we may respond appropriately.</p>\r\n<p>One researcher is Vicki Bier, professor of industrial and systems engineering, who has been studying the effects of a flu pandemic and providing planning strategies in the case that one should arise. In 2007, she and several colleagues published a report providing detailed information about when to close schools and businesses and how to prepare for the economic impacts of a flu pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Before jumping into the response plan, it is very important to understand exactly what characterizes a flu outbreak as a pandemic rather than a normal flu season. A flu pandemic is described by the World Health Organization as an outbreak caused by a strain of flu that is new to a population, and easily spreads and infects that population. With a flu pandemic, people won’t initially have immunity to the virus, giving it the ability to spread more widely and more quickly. Professor Bier’s paper estimates that 30 percent to 40 percent of people in a workplace may be absent during a flu pandemic. “It’s similar to a snow day but it’s a snow day that could last for weeks and you can’t really get back to business in a day or two,” Bier says.</p>\r\n<p>The initial idea for the pandemic response paper was Professor Bier’s own. “Back when people we were more concerned about avian flu, it occurred to me that there were a lot of things that individual organizations had to do for themselves,” Bier says. “I initially started by putting on a workshop and had a lot of volunteers in planning, both from government agencies, from the private sector and the university.” She was later approached by the U.S. Department of Health and asked to help plan for a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>In writing the paper, Bier and her fellow researchers  turned to history for some insight. They looked back at the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic to compare the actions taken by various cities and whether those actions were successful. While records were not as well kept 100 years ago as they are now, the researchers found that the cities that took stronger actions seemed to have, in general, less illness, Bier says.</p>\r\n<p>The paper itself doesn’t focus so much on the medical aspects of a pandemic, such as vaccines or medicine, because the effects of a pandemic would reach beyond any hospital or pharmacy. “We tried to focus on some of the broader systems issues or social issues that could be affected by a pandemic. The three things we chose [to focus on] were school closure, business closure and what would happen as far as the needs of the working poor,” says Bier.</p>\r\n<p>They found that the effects of a pandemic would be much broader than just a medical issue to be dealt with by public health officials. “A dire situation would go beyond what public health could handle and involve a lot of other parts of society,” says Bier.</p>\r\n<p>So just how should governments, schools and businesses respond to the impacts of a flu pandemic?</p>\r\n<p>“The big interventions early on are what the public health people call non-pharmaceutical interventions,” Professor Bier says. Non-pharmaceutical interventions include many common-sense measures like thorough hand-washing and staying home when sick. Other things to consider may be slowing the spread of influenza by canceling events that draw large crowds.  “One of the things we looked at was whether we would cancel football games or other major social events,” says Bier.</p>\r\n<p>While many Badger fans may gasp at the thought of canceling an entire football season, it could be a necessary measure to slow the spread of a flu pandemic. Ironically enough, the H1N1 virus hit the UW-Madison football team this past fall. While the team was able to beat the viral opponent, the episode highlighted how quickly the disease can spread. In a crowd of 80,000 at Camp Randall, this is a serious concern.</p>\r\n<p>While closing down Camp Randall for an entire season would be disappointing, canceled football games would not be the end of the world. However, in some cases, it may not be possible to shut down some businesses or industries. “There are some critical industries that need to remain open,” Professor Bier says. These include things like electricity, gas and other utilities, or even grocery stores and medicine. “Most of those critical industries have already done a lot of their own planning,” she says, but the paper also explores the possibility that government assistance may be needed to maintain some critical infrastructures.</p>\r\n<p>Just as in a typical flu season, children would play a major role in  the transmission of a deadly virus in the case of a pandemic. The close confines of classrooms and lecture halls are a breeding ground for deadly flu viruses, so it would be extremely important to consider the closure of schools. The question of when schools should be closed, however, is a difficult one to answer. “It [isn’t] clear to me that closing schools when there [is] a high rate of absenteeism is soon enough,” Bier says.</p>\r\n<p>Such a widespread closure of schools and businesses would not go unnoticed by society or the economy. In fact, the state of Wisconsin would see about a 2 percent loss in annual <span class=\\"caps\\">GDP</span> from a pandemic. Typically, the businesses that would first require closing would be those in the entertainment and hospitality industry. “Businesses may suffer the most from a large amount of workers being absent, or limited clients and revenue. It really is a trade-off with severity of disease,” Professor Bier says. “The more severe the pandemic, the more dire the economic consequences may be. But in the end, losing several weeks of class or a month’s revenue will be worth saving lives from a flu pandemic.”</p>\r\n<p>In addition to business and school closure, one of the most unique aspects of Professor Bier’s paper explores the needs of the working poor and how they would be impacted by a flu pandemic. As it is, families living paycheck-to-paycheck would suffer the most from such a pandemic, because they could lose irreplaceable wages due to missing work. As a result, these families might turn to government assistance, putting more of a strain on the government’s resources. Furthermore, low-wage industries are very susceptible to closures, resulting in unemployment for the workers.</p>\r\n<p>While people may be concerned about the impacts of a flu pandemic, they can find relief knowing that government, schools and businesses have action plans. It is true that scientists may never be able to predict just how severe a flu pandemic may be. However, thanks to Professor Bier and her colleagues, we now know how best to respond to a pandemic to keep our lives moving along as usual.</p>', 'Lauren Kern', '', '', 'Alex Bird', '2010-02-03', NULL),

As “Good Morning America” broke into commercial, I guided the conversation towards my work. With that, my grandfather’s mood switched from causal morning coffee to you-better-listen-good. He said to me, “Boy, in my day, there have been times when I have made a lot of money, and there have been times when I made no money at all.

Yet,  taking time for yourself is so important to maintaining the high energy and focus necessary to perform in the classroom.</p>\r\n<p>For me, the nature trails of Picnic Point and the Arboretum provided a scenic escape that allowed me to temporarily leave behind the stress of my studies. I believe that it is important to have a personal place on campus that is not associated with school or work to go and decompress.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to our amazing feats as UW-Madison students, I think what’s equally important is our ability to have fun. Take, for example, our “Great Snowman Wall of Gillman Street,” built the eve of our snow day this past semester.</p>\r\n<p>As I enter the real world, the simplest words of wisdom I can offer are to have fun. When you are working hard and there seems no end in sight, take a break and get away to your personal sanctuary for a brief spell of rest and relaxation. Taking a personal break to get out and play is so important. I believe that this past semester’s snow day exemplified UW-Madison students’ eccentric nature and great knack for having fun.</p>\r\n<p>Navigating through the challenges of my college experience wasn’t easy; I often found myself working long into the night, and down to the last dollar.
